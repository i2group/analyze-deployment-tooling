    "title": "Backup",
    "keywords": "Backup This section describes the process to back up the Solr collections and the Information Store database in SQL Server in an i2 Analyze deployment in a containerized environment. Understanding the back up process In a deployment of i2 Analyze, data is stored in the Information Store database and indexed in Solr collections. You must back up these components as a pair to enable you to restore the data in your system after a failure. When you back up the Solr collections, the configuration in ZooKeeper is also backed up. To ensure that data can be restored correctly, you must back up the components in the following order: Solr collections Information Store database If data is changed in the database after taking the Solr backup, Solr can update the index to reflect these changes when the collections and database are restored. When you create your backups, ensure that you store both backups so that you can identify the pair of backups that you must restore if required. Note: In the walkthrough, both the database and Solr backups are versioned using the variable backup_version . In the walkthrough the backup version is 1 . This is used to create a directory where the all of the backup files are stored for this pair. To create another backup pair, increment the backup_version so that the backup files are stored in a different directory. Backing up the Solr collections To back up Solr collections, you must have a shared filesystem available that is shared and accessible by all Solr nodes. In a containerized environment, a backup volume is shared between all Solr containers. Note: In the example, the backup volume is mounted to /backup in the Solr container. To ensure Solr can write the backup file, you must make sure the Solr process has permission to the backup folder. In order for Solr to write to the folder the user solr and group 0 must have read and write permission to the backup folder. The following chown command is an example that gives the Solr process permission to write to the backup location: chown -R solr:0 /backup The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the BACKUP API request. The backup operation must be performed for each non-transient collection. The non-transient collections are the main_index , match_index , and chart_index . The following curl command is an example that creates a backup of the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983//solr/admin/collections?action=BACKUP&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1/ \" To perform a backup operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the backup API command, see BACKUP: Backup Collection Note: The BACKUP API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the backup procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Backing up Solr section of the walkthrough script. Determining status of Solr backup The Monitoring Solr backup process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsyncRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous backup request. For more information about the client function, see getAsyncRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr backup progress section of the walkthrough script. Backing up the system match rules file The system match rules are stored in the ZooKeeper configuration, and can be backed up by using the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) from the Solr client container. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli command. The following command is an example of how to use the getfile command to retrieve the system match rules: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd getfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml Note: The system match rules file is backed up to the /backup/1/ folder where the Solr backup is located. For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . Backing up the Information Store database In the containerized environment, the mounted backup volume is used to store the backup file. Only the Information Store database is backed up. The SQL Server instance and system databases are not included in the backup. For more information about the backup volume, see Running a SQL Server . The backup is performed by a user that has the built-in db_backupoperator SQL Server role. In this case, that is the dbb user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsDBB client function to run the following SQL command to create the backup file. For example: runSQLServerCommandAsDBB bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"USE ISTORE; BACKUP DATABASE ISTORE TO DISK = '/backup/1/IStore.bak' WITH FORMAT;\\\"\" For more information about backing up a SQL Server database, see: Backup SQL Documentation SQL Server Backup Permissions For more information about the dbb user and it's role, see: db users See the Backing up SQL Server section of the walkthrough script."

Understanding the restore process To restore the data and indexes for a deployment of i2 Analyze, restore the pair of Solr collection and Information Store database backups. To ensure that the data is restored correctly, restore the pair of backups in the following order: Information Store database Solr collections If any data has changed in the Information Store after the Solr backup, the Solr index is updated to reflect the contents of the Information Store database when Liberty is started. Preparing the environment Before you can restore the backups, clean down the Solr, ZooKeeper & SQL Server environment if you are not using a clean environment. See the Simulating Clean down section of the walkthrough script. Stop the liberty servers Before the restore process can begin you must stop the liberty servers. In a this can be done by stopping the containers The following command is an example of how to stop the liberty containers: docker container stop liberty1 liberty2 Restoring the Information Store database The process of restoring the Information Store database contains the following steps: Running a SQL Server container with a new instance of SQL Server Creating the Information Store database from the backup file in the new instance Recreating the required logins in the new SQL Server instance, and the users in the restored database Running a SQL Server container Run a container for the new instance of SQL Server, this will have the backup directory available. For more information about running a SQL Server container, see SQL Server . See the Running the SQL Server section of the walkthrough script. Creating the database from the backup file In a new instance of SQL Server, the only user is the sa user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function to run the following SQL command as the sa user to create the ISTORE database from the backup file: runSQLServerCommandAsSA bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"RESTORE DATABASE ISTORE FROM DISK = '/backup/IStore.bak;'\" See the Restoring the ISTORE database section of the walkthrough script. Recreating the logins and users In SQL Server, a login is scoped to the Database Engine. To connect to a specific database, in this case the ISTORE database, a login must be mapped to a database user. Because the backup is completed for the ISTORE database only, the logins from the previous SQL Server instance cannot be restored. Additionally, the database users are restored but there are no logins mapped to them. For more information about SQL Server logins, see SQL Server Login documentation In this environment, create the required logins and users by dropping the users from the database and recreating the logins and the users by using the createDbLoginAndUser client function. The logins and users are created in the same way as when original SQL Server instance was configured. For more information about creating the required logins, users, and permissions, see Configuring SQL Server in the deployment documentation. See the Dropping existing database users and Recreating database logins, users, and permissions sections of the walkthrough script. Restoring the Solr collections Restoring the solr indexes includes the following high-level steps: Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble Restore the non-transient Solr collections Monitor the restore process until completed Recreate transient Solr collections Restore system match rules Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble To restore the Solr indexes, deploy a new Solr cluster & ZooKeeper ensemble. For more information about running a clean ZooKeeper & Solr environment, see Running Solr and ZooKeeper . Create Solr cluster . See the Deploying Clean Solr & Zookeeper section of the walkthrough script. Restoring the non-transient Solr collections The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the RESTORE API request. The restore operation must be performed for each non-transient collection that was backed up. The following curl command is an example that restores the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=RESTORE&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1\" \" To perform a restore operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the Restore API command, see RESTORE: Restore Collection . Note: The restore API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the restore procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Restoring non-transient Solr collection section of the walkthrough script. Determining completion of Solr restore procedure The Monitoring Solr restore process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsyncRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous request. For more information about the client function, see getAsyncRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr restore progress section of the walkthrough script. Recreate transient Solr collections Recreate the transient daod_index , vq_index , and highlightquery_index Solr collections. For more information about the creating Solr collections, see Configuring Solr and ZooKeeper . See the Recreating transient Solr collections section of the walkthrough script. Restore system match rules After the indexes are restored, upload the system match rules file. Use the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) to create the directory in ZooKeeper for the system match rules file and to upload it. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli request. The following command creates the directory in ZooKeeper where the system match rules file must be stored: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd makepath /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app Note: The path to where the system match rules file must be located is in the following format configs/<index name>/<index name>/app The following command uploads the system match rules file to the directory in ZooKeeper created earlier: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd putfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . See the Restoring system match rules section of the walkthrough script. Start the Liberty containers After the Solr collections and Information Store database are restored, start the Liberty containers. The following command is an example of how to start the Liberty containers: docker container start liberty1 liberty2 After the Liberty containers have started, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceToBeLive common function ensures that the i2 Analyze service is running.

For example: DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN=\"i2c_istore\" Process overview: Create a custom connector image Update the configuration to reference connectors Build connector images and redeploy Creating a connector image Create a connector image from one of the image templates. You can deploy connectors using the following templates: Spring Boot for Java based connectors i2 Connect server for Node v16 based connectors developed using the i2 Connect server SDK NodeJS for Node v16 based connectors External for connectors hosted outside of the config development environment The connector should be secured and run on port 3443 . For more information about securing your system, see Securing i2 Analyze . Spring Boot based connector image Copy the /templates/springboot-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the springboot-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - target - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy your connector code into the target directory of the connector directory. For example, copy your .jar file into the <connector_name>/target directory. Next, configure your connector . i2 Connect server based connector image Copy the /templates/i2connect-server-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the i2connect-server-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - app - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ...

Key Description id An identifier that is unique for all connectors that will be deployed. name A name for the connector that is displayed to users in the client. configurationPath The full path to the configuration endpoint of the connector. By default, it is /config . gatewaySchema The short name of an optional gateway schema. When no gateway schema is used, do not provide a value. Add the referenced schema and charting scheme to the gateway-schemas directory. type Used to identify the type of connector. For i2 Connect server connectors, set to i2connect-server . For external connectors, set to external . For any other connectors, the type key is not required. sendSensitiveHeaders This setting effectively disables connectors that employ user-specific configuration. baseUrl Used only for connectors of type external . The baseUrl value is the URL address of the connector. For any other connectors, the baseUrl key is not required. For example: { \"id\": \"connector1\", \"name\": \"Connector 1\", \"description\": \"First connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template\", \"sendSensitiveHeaders\": \"false\", \"type\": \"i2connect-server\" } or { \"id\": \"connector2\", \"name\": \"Connector 2\", \"description\": \"Second connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template\", \"sendSensitiveHeaders\": \"false\", \"type\": \"external\", \"baseUrl\": \"https://example-connector:3443\" } Note: If your external connector is hosted in a Docker container on a different network to your config development environment, connect the Liberty container to the same network as your external connector container. For example, run docker network connect <connector-network-name> liberty1.<config-name> . If your connector is running on your host machine, use the IP address of your host machine in the baseUrl value. Provide the version of the connector in the <connector_name>/connector-version.json file. For external connectors, this file is not required. The version value specifies the version of the connector. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"0-0-1\" } For more information about configuring connectors, see Managing connectors . Adding connectors to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your connector with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file and add the directory name for your connector in the connectors array. For example, to add the connector in connector-images\\example-connector the connector-references.json file contains the following connectors array: { \"connectors\": [ { \"name\": \"example-connector\" } ], ... } Defining a gateway schema (Optional) You can develop the gateway schema and associated charting schemes by following the instructions in Developing schemas in your configuration development environment . After you develop the schemes, complete the following steps to add deploy them with your configuration: Copy the schema and charting scheme files to the /gateway-schemas directory. To define the short name of the gateway schema, the prefix of the file name is used. The convention is defined as: <short>-<name>-schema.xml and <short>-<name>-schema-charting-scheme.xml . For example, files with the names law-enforcement-schema.xml and law-enforcement-charting-schemes.xml have the short name law-enforcement . Add the short name of your schema to the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file in the gatewaySchemas array. For example, to add a gateway schema with the short name law-enforcement , the file contains the following gatewaySchemas array: { ... ], \"gatewaySchemas\": [ { \"shortName\": \"law-enforcement\" } ] } Note: If you are not using any gateway schemas, do not remove the gatewaySchemas key from the file. Set the short name of your schema in the <connector_name>/connector-definition.json as the value for the gatewaySchema key of the connector that will use the gateway schema.

To add it as a dependency, populate the values of the pom.xml file as follows: <!-- Extension specific dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>com.i2group</groupId> <artifactId>opal-audit-example-common</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> </dependency> You will also need to populate the i2a-extensions/extension-dependencies.json file, for example: [ { \"name\": \"opal-audit-file-example\", \"dependencies\": [ \"opal-audit-example-common\" ] } ] Adding extensions to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your extension with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/extension-references.json file and add the directory name for your extension in the extensions array. For example, to add the extension in i2a-extensions/opal-default-security-example the extension-references.json file contains the following extensions array: { \"extensions\": [ { \"name\": \"opal-default-security-example\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" } ] } Note: The extensions in the extension-references.json file are loaded in order. If an extension depends on another extension, define the dependent extension first. Deploying your extension Use the deploy.sh script to build the extensions for your configuration. For example, to build and deploy the extensions declared in extension-references.json for your configuration: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> Debugging your extension Deploying in debug mode To deploy with one or more Liberty servers running in debug mode, change the local variable DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS in utils/internalHelperVariables.sh to be a list of the container names of the liberty servers you wish to run in debug mode. For example: DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS=(\"${LIBERTY1_CONTAINER_NAME}\") Then deploy from a clean environment. When the Liberty servers start they all wait for a debugger to be attached before continuing. Note: Each Liberty server will open and expose a unique debug port (starting at port 7777) and wait for a debugger. This behavior is defined by the WLP_DEBUG_SUSPEND environment variable in the liberty container and could be changed if needed. Attaching a debugger The project is shipped with a default launch configuration which can be changed in .vscode/launch.json . Run the Java debugger by pressing F5 and choose Debug Extensions if asked."

In a containerized deployment, all log messages are also displayed in the console. You can use the docker logs command to view the console log. The libertyHadrFailureWalkthrough.sh script simulates the Liberty leader failure. Identifying the leader Liberty To simulate a failure of the leader Liberty, first identify which server hosts the leader instance. To identify which container is running the leader Liberty, check the logs of the Liberty servers for the message: We are the Liberty leader . In the walkthrough script, this is done with the following grep command: grep -q \"We are the Liberty leader\" See the Identifying the leader Liberty section of the walkthrough script. Simulating leader Liberty failure To simulate leader Liberty failure, stop the leader Liberty. For example, if liberty1 is the leader, run: docker stop liberty1 See the Simulating leader Liberty failure section of the walkthrough script. Detecting failure The load balancer is used to monitor and determine the status of the i2 Analyze service. The load balancer is configured to report the status of the deployment. The status can be either ACTIVE , DEGRADED , or DOWN . When the leader is taken offline, the other Liberty server must restart to become the new leader. During this time, both servers are down and the i2 Analyze service is DOWN . When the new leader Liberty starts and only 1 of the servers is down, the status of the i2 Analyze services is DEGRADED . In the walkthrough, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is used to run a while loop around the geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function to wait until the i2 Analyze service is in the DEGRADED state. The geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is an example of how to return the i2 Analyze service status from a load balancer. See the Detecting failure section of the walkthrough script.

Docker run command The following docker run command runs a Grafana container: docker run -d \\ --name \"grafana\" \\ --net \"eia\" \\ --net-alias \"grafana.eia\" \\ -p \"3500:3000\" \\ -v \"grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana\" \\ -v \"grafana_dashboards:/etc/grafana/dashboards\" \\ -v \"grafana_provisioning:/etc/grafana/provisioning\" \\ -v \"grafana_secrets:/run/secrets\" \\ -e GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=\"grafana\" \\ -e GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=\"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD\" \\ -e GF_SERVER_PROTOCOL=\"https\" \\ -e GF_SERVER_CERT_FILE=\"/run/secrets/server.cer\" \\ -e GF_SERVER_CERT_KEY=\"/run/secrets/server.key\" \\ -e PROMETHEUS_URL=\"https://prometheus.eia:9090\" \\ -e PROMETHEUS_USERNAME=\"prometheus\" \\ -e PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD=\"prometheus\" \\ -e SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE=\"SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE\" \\ \"grafana/grafana-oss:8.5.3\" For an example of the docker run command, see serverFunctions.sh . The runGrafana function does not take any arguments. Volumes A named volume or a bind mount can be used to persist data and logs that are generated and used in the Grafana container. To configure the Grafana container to use the volume, specify the -v option with the name of the volume and the path where the directory is mounted in the container. By setting -v option in the docker run command, a named volume is created. For Grafana, the directory that must be mounted is /var/lib/grafana . For example: -v \"grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana\" \\ -v \"grafana_dashboards:/etc/grafana/dashboards\" \\ -v \"grafana_provisioning:/etc/grafana/provisioning\" \\ -v \"grafana_secrets:/run/secrets\" \\ For more information, see Run Grafana container with persistent storage . Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access prometheus and certificates used in SSL. The directory is used to update the named volume location defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER__FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. Environment variables To configure Grafana, you can provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. Grafana environment variables All the configuration options in Grafana can be overridden by environment variables like GF_<SectionName>_<KeyName> . For more information about Grafana environment variables, see Override configuration with environment variables . Environment variable Description GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER The Grafana administrator user name. GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD The Grafana administrator password. Grafana SSL The following environment variables enable you use SSl with Grafana Environment variable Description GF_SERVER_PROTOCOL The Grafana server protocol. GF_SERVER_CERT_FILE The Grafana administrator password. GF_SERVER_CERT_KEY The Grafana administrator password. Prometheus authentication The following environment variables are used to configure Grafana to connect to Prometheus as a client: Environment variable Description PROMETHEUS_USERNAME The Prometheus username. PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD The Prometheus password. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE See Secure Environment variables ."

The liberty_ubi_base contains static configuration and application jars that are required by i2 Analyze and should not be changed. The liberty_ubi_base image is built on top a Liberty image maintained by i2 Group on Docker Hub. Building a Liberty base image The Liberty base image for i2 Analyze is built on top of a Liberty image maintained by i2 Group on Docker Hub. Docker build command The base image is built from the Dockerfile in images/liberty_ubi_base . The following docker build command builds the Liberty base image: docker build -t \"liberty_ubi_base:4.4.0\" images/liberty_ubi_base \\ --build-arg I2ANALYZE_VERSION=\"4.4.0\" For examples of the build commands, see buildImages.sh script. Configuring the Liberty server Liberty is configured by exception. The runtime environment operates from a set of built-in configuration default settings, and you only need to specify configuration that overrides those default settings. You do this by editing either the server.xml file or another XML file that is included in server.xml at run time. In a containerized deployment of i2 Analyze, a server.xml file is provided for you. To provide or modify any values, you specify a number of environment variables when you run a Liberty container. Additionally, you can extend the server.xml by using the provided server.extensions.xml in the i2 Analyze configuration. Any elements that you add to the extensions file are included in the server.xml when you run a Liberty container. Configuring the i2 Analyze application The contents of the configuration directory must be copied into the images/liberty_ubi_combined/classes directory. The contents of the classes directory is added to the configured Liberty image when the image is built. If you make changes to the configuration, you must copy the changes to the classes directory and rebuild the configured image. Note: The system match rules are configured differently. The application is updated to use the system-match-rules.xml from the Solr client command line. For more information about updating the system match rules, see Updating the system match rules .

The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. This is achieved by using a bind mount. In production this would not be required. Configuration : The Solr client requires the i2 Analyze configuration to perform some Solr operations. To access the configuration, the configuration directory must be mounted into the container. Environment variables To configure the Solr client, you can provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. Environment variable Description SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME For usage see Command Parsing SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD For usage see Command Parsing ZOO_DIGEST_USERNAME The ZooKeeper administrator user name. This environment variable maps to the zkDigestUsername system property. ZOO_DIGEST_PASSWORD The ZooKeeper administrator password. This environment variable maps to the zkDigestPassword system property. ZOO_DIGEST_READONLY_USERNAME The ZooKeeper read-only user name. This environment variable maps to the zkDigestReadonlyUsername system property. ZOO_DIGEST_READONLY_PASSWORD The ZooKeeper read-only password.

SSL_CERTIFICATE See Secure Environment Variables . SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE See Secure Environment Variables . Command parsing When commands are passed to the Solr client by using the \"$@\" notation, the command that is passed to the container must be escaped correctly. On the container, the command is run using docker exec \"$@\" . Because the command is passed to the docker run command using bash -c , the command must be maintained as a double quoted string. For example: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert ${CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR}/CA.cer \\\"${SOLR1_BASE_URL}/solr/main_index/update?commit=true\\\" -H Content-Type:text/xml --data-binary \\\"<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>\\\"\" Different parts of the command must be escaped in different ways: \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" Because the curl command uses the container's local environment variables to obtain the values of SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME and SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD , the $ is escaped by a \\ . The \" around both of the variables are escaped with a \\ to prevent the splitting of the command, which means that the variables are evaluated in the container's environment. \\\"${SOLR1_BASE_URL}/solr/main_index/update?commit=true\\\" The URL is surrounded in \" because the string contains a variable. The \" are escaped with a \\ .

Data sets The /i2a-data directory is used to contain the data sets that you ingest into the Information Store of a deployment. The data that you ingest into the Information Store must conform to the Information Store schema. However, one data set can be ingested with different configs. There is not a 1-to-1 mapping between data sets and configs. Each data set must contain at least one ingestion script. This script contains the functions that populate the staging tables with your data and calls the ETL toolkit tools that ingest the data. The expected directory structure is as follows: - i2a-data - <data_set> - scripts - <script1> - <script2> Ingesting data into the config dev environment The manageData.sh script is used to manage the ingestion process in the dev environment.

For more information, see: - ETL tools - Ingesting data into the Information Store You can find example scripts in the examples/ingestion/scripts directory. These scripts demonstrate how to create staging tables, populate them, and ingest the data into the Information Store. To run scripts, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t ingest -d <data_set> -s <script_name> Where: <config_name> is the name of the config that is currently deployed and running in the config dev environment <data_set> is the name of a directory in i2a-data <script_name> is the name of a script in the directory specified for <data_set> Creating ingestion sources The ingestion sources for a config are contained in the configuration. Ingestion sources are defined in <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh . Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh file to the <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/ directory. In the script, the INGESTION_SOURCES array contains the name and description of 2 example sources. INGESTION_SOURCES=( [Example Ingestion Source 1]=EXAMPLE_1 [Example Ingestion Source 2]=EXAMPLE_2 ) You can modify or add to the array of ingestion sources. To create the ingestion sources in the array, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t sources Example ingestion process The i2 Analyze minimal toolkit contains the example law-enforcement-data-set-1 data that can be ingested when the example law enforcement schema ( law-enforcement-schema.xml ) is deployed. This contains a number of CSV files that contain the data, and a mapping.xml file. For more information about the mapping file, see Ingestion mapping files . Before you can ingest the law enforcement example data, complete the following steps to provide the data set and scripts: Copy the pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory to the i2a-data directory. Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts directory to the i2a-data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory.

The complete contents of each connector directory depends on the template that you used to create it. All the templates include a folder that you use to place the connector source code, the files used to build the Docker images and run the Docker containers, and JSON files that you use to provide information about the connector. For instructions about how to add connectors to your environment, see Adding connectors to your development environment . Connector versioning You specify the version and tag of a connector in the connector-version.json file of each connector. version The version value is used as a version for your connector. If you are deploying an i2 Connect server connector, the version value has more requirements. For more information, see i2 Connect server connector versioning . tag The tag value is used in the image name, host name, and secrets for your connector container. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"1-0-0\" } Building connectors Use the deploy.sh script to generate secrets and build the images for connectors referenced in that config. For example, to build and run all of the connectors referenced in the <config-name> config, run: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> To build the images for all connectors in your environment, see Managing the environment . Connector secrets Before you can use a connector, you must generate secrets for it. For more information about the secrets used in the environment, see Managing container security . The secrets that are generated for a particular connector are tied to the tag, if you change the tag you must to regenerate the secrets for that connector. To regenerate the secrets for a connector after you change the tag, complete the following steps: Remove the dev-environment-secrets/<connector_name> directory for the connector that you changed the tag of. Run the deploy.sh script with a config that references the connector. ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> Note: To secure the connection to an external connector, you must install the following certificates where the connector is running. At this release, your connector must be configured to use the certificates signed by the config development environment CA. dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/<connector-name>/server.key dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/<connector-name>/server.cer dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/CA/CA.cer i2 Connect server connectors If you are deploying one or more connectors that were developed using the i2 Connect SDK. There are two versions that you must consider; the version of a connector and the version of the i2 Connect server that the connectors depends on. Connector version In the connector-version.json file, the version specifies the range of supported versions for the connector. This enables you to have more control of the version of a connector that is used in your deployment. You can specify the range of versions at the major, minor, or patch level. For example, if you specify a major version 1 in the connector-version.json file, any connector that has a major version of 1 is compatible. When the connector is developed, the version of the connector is provided in the package.json file by the developer. If the version of the connector specified in package.json does not match the version, or range of versions, that you specify in connector-version.json a warning is displayed when you deploy your environment. The following table demonstrates how you can specify the version ranges and their compatibility with connector versions: package.json version connector-version.json version Compatible? (Y/N) 1.0.0 1 Y 1.3.0 1 Y 1.4.0 1.3 N 1.4.6 1.4 Y 1.4.8 1.4.7 N 2.0.0 1 N i2 Connect server version i2 Connect server connectors depend on the i2 Connect server. When the connector is developed, the version of the i2 Connect server that the connector depends on is provided in the package.json file by the developer. In the connector-images/i2connect-server-version.json file, you specify the range of versions of the i2 Connect server that you want all i2 Connect server connectors to depend on. The versions in these files are specified in the npm semantic versioning syntax. For more information about the syntax, see semver - the semantic versioning for npm . If the version of the i2 Connect server that a connector depends on specified in package.json does not match the version, or range of versions, that you specify in i2connect-server-version.json a warning is displayed when you deploy your environment. The following table demonstrates how you can specify the version ranges and their compatibility with i2 Connect server versions: package.json version connector-version.json version Compatible? (Y/N) ^1.0.0 ^1.0.0 Y 1.3.2 ^1.0.0 Y 1.4.0 1.3.0 N 2.0.0 ^1.0.0 N i2 Connect server connector configuration (Optional) i2 Connect server connectors can have specific connector configuration that is defined in the settings.json file. When the connector is developed, a default file can be provided by the developer. The developer should also provide you with documentation that described the required configuration for the connector. After the first deployment of the connector, if a settings.json file is provided, the system extracts it to the connector-images/<connector-name>/app directory. The file is in the same directory structure as in the supplied connector. For example, <connector-name>/app/config/settings.json . To change the configuration, modify the settings.json and redeploy the environment. You might have to provide secrets, or references to secrets, in the settings.json file. To provide the secrets, you can use a value from the environment. This can either be an environment variable or a value from a .env file in the connector-image/<connector-name> directory. Note: If you use a .env file, it must not be checked in to source control or distributed to prevent compromising your secrets. An example settings.json file might look like: { \"data_source_url\": \"https://data-source/data.json\", \"data_source_API_key\": \"${env.API_KEY}\" } Where API_KEY is an environment variable or a key in a .env file with the value of the API Key. For more information about populating the settings.json file, see Making a connector configurable ."

    "title": "Synchronize configurations",
    "keywords": "Synchronize configurations You can synchronize configurations between the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and the configuration development environment. This enables you to develop the i2 Analyze configuration by using the config development environment, and deploy with it as part of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. This can be useful in the following situations: You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration. When you synchronize a configuration, you must do so with a complete i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. You can synchronize from an existing deployment toolkit configuration (import) or from an existing configuration development config (export). The configuration from the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit is the source of truth. When you have an existing deployment toolkit, the instructions direct you to back up the configuration before you synchronize it with the config development environment. You complete the synchronization by using the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script. Examples The following use cases demonstrate the process of synchronizing configurations between the config development environment and an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit: Use case 1 : You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. Use case 2 : You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to convert to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration. After you develop the configuration, you will still deploy i2 Analyze using the deployment toolkit. Use case 1 Use the config development environment to create and develop a config. For more information, see Configuration development environment . When you are happy with the developed configuration, you can complete the process that enables you to use it with the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Install the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. For more information, see Installing i2 Analyze . To mount the directory where you installed the i2 Analyze toolkit to the dev container, open the devcontainer.json file inside .devcontainer directory. In the mounts object, add the path to the toolkit directory as the source and target. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ). If your toolkit is on the Windows filesystem, access it by using the /mnt directory. For example: \"mounts\": [ ... \"source=/mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit,target=/mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit,type=bind,consistency=cached\" ] Press F1 (or Cmd+Shift+P in MacOS) and type Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container and select it. Export the configuration from the config development environment to the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the create task to create a base configuration in the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit -t create Where: -c is the name of the config. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was mounted into the dev container. Note: The base configuration that is created is suitable for the deployment pattern that is specified in the variables.sh file of the specified config. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task to export the config dev configuration into the deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the name of the config to export. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was mounted into the dev container. You can then deploy your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . Start at step 3 from the linked documentation. There are a number of environment specific configuration files that are not populated in the config development environment. Use case 2 This section assumes that you are starting with a configuration from an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . The config development environment uses fixed names for schemas and configuration files. Before you can import your deployment toolkit configuration into the config development environment, your configuration must be updated to use the expected file names. The manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script can rename the files for you and update any references to them. You can also decide whether or not to use the config development environment configuration set in your deployment toolkit configuration. If you decide to use the new config set, all settings for the deployment must be specified in the analyze-settings.properties file. If you choose not to use the new configuration set, any additions that you make to the analyze-settings file in the config development environment are not exported. Back up your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. Fore more information about backing up your configuration, see Back up and restore the configuration . Use the config development environment to create an empty config to import your configuration in to. For more information, see Configuration development environment . You do not need to specify any schema files or deploy the config. To mount the directory where your i2 Analyze toolkit is installed to the dev container, open the devcontainer.json file inside .devcontainer directory. In the mounts object, add the path to the toolkit directory as the source and target. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ). If your toolkit is on the Windows filesystem, access it by using the /mnt directory. For example: \"mounts\": [ ... \"source=/mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit,target=/mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit,type=bind,consistency=cached\" ] Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the prepare task to rename the schema and configuration files and update the references: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit -t prepare Where: -c is the config name you are working with. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was mounted into the dev container. To use the config development environment configuration set, complete the following 2 steps. Otherwise, move to step 5. Copy the contents of templates/toolkit-config-mod directory to the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes directory of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Review the settings that are used in the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files of i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and move any settings that you want to continue using into the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes/analyze-settings.properties file. You can remove the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files after you move any settings. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the import task to import the configuration into the config development environment: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit -t import Where: -c is the config name to import the configuration into. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was mounted into the dev container. Use the config development environment to develop the configuration. For more information, see Developing the configuration . In the config development environment, a user.registry.xml is required. You can start from the example provided in pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/security and align it to your security schema or copy in an existing one. If you want to use your developed configuration in your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, you can use the export task to export the configuration into your toolkit. Otherwise, continue to use the config development environment. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task. For example: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/i2/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the config name you have created to synchronize the configuration to. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was mounted into the dev container. You must update the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit deployment with the changes to the configuration. Connectors In the config development environment, i2 Connect connectors are run on Docker images and can only be access from within the Docker network. This means that the connectors and URL references to the connectors cannot be synchronized between configurations. The connector IDs are displayed when you run the import and export tasks to enable you to provide the connectors in each environment. For more information about deploying connectors, see: Adding connectors to your config development environment Adding connectors to your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration Extensions In the config development environment, i2Analyze extensions are built and deployed using Maven. To add an extension to your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, copy the JAR from i2a-extensions/<extension-name>/target/<extension-name>-<version>.jar and follow the DevEssentials deployment steps. For more information, see Configuring the 'group-based default security dimension values' example project for an example of the steps to take. Prometheus and Grafana In the config development environment, Prometheus and Grafana are run on Docker images. You can modify the configs/<config-name>/configuration/prometheus/prometheus.yml file and the Grafana dashboards in configs/<config-name>/configuration/grafana/dashboards folder to further develop your metrics configuration and once finished this can be copied to the locations that are required by Prometheus and Grafana.

    "keywords": "Database roles, users, and logins During the deployment, administration, and use of i2 Analyze, a number of different actions are completed against the Information Store database. These actions can be separated into different categories that are usually completed by users with differing permissions. In SQL Server, you can create a number of database roles and assign users to roles. In the example deployment, a number of different roles and users are used to demonstrate the types of roles that might complete each action. Database roles In the example, the following roles are used: Role Description DBA_Role The DBA_Role is used to perform database administrative tasks. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role is used to move data from an external system into the staging tables in the Information Store database. i2_ETL_Role The i2_ETL_Role is used to read data from the staging tables and ingest it into - and delete it from - the Information Store database. i2analyze_Role The i2analyze_Role is used to complete actions required by the Liberty application. For example, returning results for Visual Queries. Database role permissions Each database role requires a specific set of permissions to complete the actions attributed to them. DBA_Role The DBA_Role requires permissions to: Set up and maintain the database management system and Information Store database. Create and modify the database management system objects. For example, bufferpools, tablespoons, and filegroups. Create and modify database objects. For example, tables, views, indexes, sequences. Troubleshoot performance or other issues. For example, has all privileges on all tables. This can be restricted in some environments. Configure high availability. Manage backup and recovery activities. Additionally, the role requires access to two roles in the msdb database: SQLAgentUserRole - for more information, see SQLAgentUserRole Permissions db_datareader - for more information, see Fixed-Database Roles These roles are required for database creation, to initialize the deletion-by-rule objects, and to create the SQL Server Agent jobs for the deletion rules. Note: The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is run during deploy to grant the correct permissions. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes All CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM Required to create the database objects. All ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, REFERENCES Required to make changes for maintaining the database. IS_Core EXECUTE Required for deletion-by-rule and database configuration. IS_Public EXECUTE Required to run the stored procedures for deletion-by-rule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the msdb database: Schema Permissions Notes dbo SQLAgentUserRole Required to create the deletion jobs during deployment, and to manage the deletion job schedule. dbo db_datareader Required to create the deletion job schedule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the master database: Schema Permissions Notes All VIEW SERVER STATE Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs via the SQL Server Agent. sys EXECUTE ON fn_hadr_is_primary_replica Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs. The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is used to configure the DBA user with all the required role memberships and permissions. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role requires permissions to move data from external systems into the Information Store staging tables. For example, it can be used by an ETL tool - such as DataStage or Informatica - to move and transform data that results in populated staging tables in the Information Store staging schema. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to populate the staging tables with date to be ingested or deleted. In addition to these permissions, in an environment running SQL server in a Linux container, users with this role must also be a member of the sysadmin group in order to perform BULK INSERT into the external staging tables. The addEtlUserToSysAdminRole.sh script is used to make the etl user a member of the sysadmin fixed-server role. i2_ETL_Role The i2_ETL_Role requires permissions to use the i2 Analyze ingestion tools to ingest data from the staging tables into the Information Store. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required by the ingestion tools to create and modify objects during the ingestion process. IS_Stg ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required by the ingestion tools to create and modify objects during the ingestion process. IS_Meta SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT UPDATE and INSERT are required to update the ingestion history table. SELECT is required to read the schema meta data. IS_Data ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ALTER is required to drop and create indexes and update statistics as part of the ingestion process. IS_Public ALTER, SELECT ALTER is required to delete and create synonyms when enabling merged property views. IS_Core SELECT, EXECUTE Required to check configuration of the database. i2analyze_Role The i2analyze_Role requires permissions to complete actions required by the Liberty application. These actions include: Visual Query, Find Path, Expand, Add to chart, Upload, and Online upgrade. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to run deletion-by-rule jobs. IS_Stg ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to upload and delete records via Analyst's Notebook Premium and to run deletion-by-rule jobs. IS_Meta SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE DELETE is required to process the ingestion history queue. IS_Data SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE are required by deletion-by-rule and to upload and delete records via Analyst's Notebook Premium. IS_Core SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required for online upgrade. IS_VQ SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to complete Visual Queries. IS_FP SELECT, INSERT, EXEC Required to complete Find Path operations. IS_WC SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to work with Web Charts. IS_PUBLIC EXEC Grants execute permission to stored procedures in the IS_PUBLIC schema. Required to create and send Alerts. The database backup operator role The example also demonstrates how to perform a database backup. The dbb user will perform this action and is a member of the SQL Server built-in role, db_backupoperator . This gives this user the correct permissions for performing a backup and nothing else. For more information, see Fixed-Database Roles for more details. Database users and logins In the example, a user is created for each role described previously. These users are then used throughout the deployment and administration steps to provide a reference for when each role is required. The following users and logins are used in the example: User and login Description Secrets sa The system administrator user. The sa user has full permissions on the database instance. This user creates the Information Store database, roles, users, and logins. The password is in the sa_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. i2analyze The i2analyze user is a member of the i2analyze_Role . The password is in the i2analyze_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. etl The etl user is a member of External_ETL_Role . The password is in the etl_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. i2etl The i2etl user is a member of i2_ETL_Role . The password is in the i2etl_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. dba The dba user is a member of DBA_Role . The password is in the dba_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. dbb The dbb user is the database backup user, it is a member of the SQL Server built in role: db_backupoperator . The password is in the dbb_PASSWORD file in the dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/sqlserver directory. The sa user and login exists on the base SQL Server image. The sa user is used to create the following artifacts: Database: ISTORE Roles: i2analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role, , i2_ETL_Role and DBA_Role Logins: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb Users: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb The roles and users must be created after the Information Store database is created. Creating the roles The sa user is used to run the createDbRoles.sh client function that creates the i2Analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role , i2_ETL_Role , and DBA_Role roles. To create the roles, the createDbRoles.sh script is run using the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function. This function uses an ephemeral SQL Server client container to create the database roles. For more information about the client function, see: runSQLServerCommandAsSA createDbRoles.sh In the example, the createDbRoles.sh script is called in deploy.sh . Note: All the secrets required at runtime by the client container can be made available by providing a file path to the secret which is converted to an environment variable by the docker container. For example, to provide the SA_USERNAME environment variable to the client container, a file containing the secret is declared in the docker run command: -e \"SA_USERNAME_FILE=${CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR}/SA_USERNAME_FILE\" The file name can be anything, but the environment variable is fixed. For more information see, managing container security Create the login and user Use the sa user to create the login and the user on the ISTORE , and make the user a member of the role. You can use an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the login and the user. The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script in /images/sql_client/db-scripts is used to create the login and user. The scripts are called from the deploy.sh scripts. The createDbLoginAndUser function The createDbLoginAndUser function uses an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the database administrator login and user. The login and user are created by the sa user. For more information about running a SQL Client container and the environment variables required for the container, see SQL Client . The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script is used to create the login and user. The function requires the following environment variables to run: Environment variable Description SA_USERNAME The sa username. SA_PASSWORD The sa user password. DB_USERNAME The database user name. DB_PASSWORD The database user password. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Whether to use SSL for connection. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The path to the CA certificate. DB_SERVER The fully qualified domain name of the database server. DB_PORT Specifies the port number to connect to the Information Store. DB_NAME The name of the Information Store database. DB_ROLE The name of the role that user will be added to. It has to be one of the roles from this list . Changing SA password In a Docker environment, you must start the SQL Server as the existing sa user before you can modify the password. The changeSAPassword function The changeSAPassword function uses an ephemeral SQL Client to change the sa user password. For more information about running a SQL Client container and the environment variables required for the container, see SQL Client . The changeSAPassword.sh script is used to change the password. The function requires the following environment variables to run: Environment variable Description SA_USERNAME The sa username SA_OLD_PASSWORD The current sa password. SA_NEW_PASSWORD The new sa password. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Whether to use SSL for connection. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The path to the CA certificate. DB_SERVER The fully qualified domain name of the database server. DB_PORT Specifies the port number to connect to the Information Store."

    "title": "Managing container security",
    "keywords": "Managing container security SSL certificates in the deployment The example deployment is configured to use SSL connections for communication between clients and i2 Analyze, and between the components of i2 Analyze. To achieve this, the appropriate certificate authorities and certificates are used. The generateSecrets.sh script is used to simulate the process of creating the required keys and acquiring certificate authority-signed certificates. Note: The keys and certificates used are set to expire after 90 days. To use the certificates for longer than this, you must run the generateSecrets.sh script again. Certificate Authorities (CA) In the example, two CAs are used to provide trust: Internal CA The internal CA is to provide trust for the containers that are used for the components of i2 Analyze. Each container's certificates are signed by the internal CA. External CA The external CA is to provide trust for external requests to the i2 Analyze service via the load balancer. In our example, the external certificate authority is generated for you. However, in production a real certificate should be used. Container certificates To communicate securely using TLS each container requires the following certificates: Private key Certificate key Internal certificate authority The containers will generate truststores and keystores based on the keys provided to the container. For more information about how the keys are passed to the containers securely please see Secure Environment variables . Secure communication between containers When the components communicate, the CA certificate is used to establish trust of the container certificate that is received. Each container has its own private key ZooKeeper requires client authentication to initiate communication. The i2 Analyze, i2 Analyze Tool, and Solr client containers require container certificates to authenticate with ZooKeeper. Creating keys and certificates The following diagram shows a simplified sequence of creating a container certificate from the certificate authority and using it to establish trust: The certificate authority's certificate is distributed to the client. The private key is generated on the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the key is created by: openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096 The public part of the private key is used in a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). In the generateSecrets.sh script, this is completed by: openssl req -new -key server.key -subj \"/CN=solr1.eia\" -out key.csr The common name that is used for the certificate is the server's fully qualified domain name. The CSR is sent to the certificate authority (CA). The CA signs and returns a signed certificate for the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the CA signing the certificate is completed by: openssl x509 -req -sha256 -CA CA.cer -CAkey CA.key -days 90 -CAcreateserial -CAserial CA.srl -extfile x509.ext -extensions \"solr\" -in key.csr -out server.cer When communication is established, the container certificate is sent to the client. The client uses it's copy of the CA certificate to verify that the container certificate was signed by the same CA. Password generation The example simulates secrets management performed by various secrets managers provided by cloud vendors. The generateSecrets.sh generates these secrets and populates the dev-environment-secrets/simulated-secret-store with secrets required for each container. The docker desktop does not support secrets, but the example environment example simulates this by mounting the secrets folder. For more information see Manage sensitive data with Docker secrets . After these passwords have been generated, they can be uploaded to a secrets manager. Alternatively you can use a secrets manager to generate your passwords. Solr Basic Authentication Solr authentication can be enabled using the BasicAuthPlugin. The basic auth plugin defines users, user roles and passwords for users. For the BasicAuthPlugin to be enabled, solr requires a security.json file to be uploaded. In our example the security.json file is created by the generateSecrets.sh and located in dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/solr/security.json . For more information about solr authentication see Basic Authentication Plugin Prometheus Basic Authentication Prometheus authentication can be enabled using the web-config.yml. The YAML file defines users and passwords for users. In our example the password is the same as the username. Grafana Basic Authentication Grafana authentication can be enabled by passing GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER and GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables to the container. In our example the password is created by generateSecrets.sh and located in dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/grafana/admin_PASSWORD . Secure Environment variables In general secrets used by a particular container can be supplied via an environment variable containing the path to a file containing the secret, or an environment variable specifying the literal secret value, for example: Note: Secrets can be passwords, keys or certificates. docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia --secret source=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD,target=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD \\ -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE\" or docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=\"jhga98u43jndfj\" The docker files in the analyze-containers repository have been modified to accept either. The convention is that the environment variable must match the property being set with \"_file\" appended if the secret is in a file, and without if a literal value is being used instead. In the example scripts, each container gets the relevant key stores mounted along with the correct secrets files in a secrets directory. NOTE: By default this is set as CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR=\"/run/secrets\" in the common variables file. All the containers use the same environment variables to define the location of certificates. These are then used to generate appropriate artifacts for the particular container. There is also a standard way of turning on and off server SSL. Security switching variables Environment variable Description SERVER_SSL Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the container is configured to use encrypted connections. LIBERTY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the Liberty container use an encrypted connection. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the database use an encrypted connection SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to ZooKeeper and Solr use an encrypted connection. GATEWAY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true of false . If set to true , connections to i2 Connect connectors use an encrypted connection. SSL_ENABLED Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the connector container communicates with the i2 Connect gateway using an encrypted connection. Security environment variables Environment variable Description SSL_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the container certificate. SSL_CERTIFICATE The container certificate. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The Certificate Authority certificate. SSL_OUTBOUND_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections. SSL_OUTBOUND_CERTIFICATE The private certificate for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections.

Clearing the search index Creating and running a delete query To clear the search index, run a Solr delete query against your indexes via the Solr API. You can run the delete query by using a curl command. In Solr, data is stored as documents. You must remove every document from each collection in your deployment. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the curl commands that remove the documents from each collection. For more information about the function, see runSolrClientCommand . The following curl command removes every document from a the main_index : curl -u \"${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\" --cacert ${CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR}/CA.cer \"${SOLR1_BASE_URL}/solr/main_index/update?commit=true\" -H Content-Type:\"text/xml\" --data-binary \"<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>\" See the Clearing the search index section of the walkthrough script. For more information about command parsing, see Command parsing Removing the collection properties The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to remove the file from ZooKeeper. For more information about the function, see runSolrClientCommand . The following zkcli call removes the collection properties for the main_index . zkcli.sh -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd clear \"/collections/main_index/collectionprops.json\" See the Clearing the search index section of the walkthrough script. The collection properties must be removed for any main, match, or chart collections. The collectionprops.json file is recreated when the i2 Analyze application is started. Clearing data from the Information Store See the Clearing the Information Store database section of the walkthrough script. The runSQLServerCommandAsDBA client function is used to run the clearInfoStoreData.sh tool to remove the data from the Information Store. runSQLServerCommandAsDBA clearInfoStoreData Running the Liberty containers The runLiberty server function runs a Liberty container. For more information about running a Liberty container, see Liberty . See the Running the Liberty containers section of the walkthrough script. Note: You must run both Liberty containers.

For more information about ingesting the data, see Ingesting data into the Information Store . During the ingestion walk-through, the default behavior is used to determine the property values of the correlated record. In the default behavior, the property values from the merge contributor with the most recent value for source_last_updated are used. For more information about the how the property values for merged records are calculated, see Define how property values of merged records are calculated After you ingest the data, in Analyst's Notebook Premium search for Julia Yochum and add the returned entity to the chart. Keep the chart open for the remainder of the walkthrough script. Enabling merged property values To inform i2 Analyze that you intend to define the property values of merged records, run the enableMergedPropertyValues.sh tool. You can take control of the property values for records of specific item types, or all item types in the i2 Analyze schema. Note that this operation must be performed by the database administrator. See the Enabling merged property values section of the walkthrough script. The runEtlToolkitToolAsDBA client function is used to run the enableMergedPropertyValues.sh tool. runEtlToolkitToolAsDBA enableMergedPropertyValues Defining the property values of merged i2 Analyze records In the mergedPropertyValuesWalkthrough.sh , the views are created for the Person item type. The enableMergedPropertyValues.sh tool is used in the Create the merged property views for the CORRELATED_SCHEMA_TYPE_IDS section. Updating property value definitions The walkthrough provides an example .sql script that drops the existing IS_Public.E_Person_MPVDV view and replaces it with another. The new view prioritizes property values from merge contributors that come from the ingestion source names EXAMPLE_1 over values from EXAMPLE_2 and any other sources. The createAlternativeMergedPropertyValuesView.sql script is in examples/pre-prod/walkthroughs/configurationChanges . After the views are enabled, the merged property values definition view ( Person_MPVDV ) is modified to change how the property values of correlated records are calculated. Note, this step is also performed by the database administrator. See the Updating property value definitions section of the walkthrough script. The runSQLServerCommandAsDBA client functions in used to run the createAlternativeMergedPropertyValuesView.sql script. runSQLServerCommandAsDBA The merged property values definition view Reingesting the data The property values of merged records do not update when the MPVDV views are modified. To update the values of existing records, you must reingest at least one of the merge contributors to the record. To do this, use the ingestDataWalkthrough.sh script to ingest some data the correlates. For more information about ingesting the data, see Ingesting data into the Information Store . See the Reingesting the data section of the walkthrough script. After the data is ingested, in the Analyst's Notebook Premium chart that you have open, select the Julia Yochum item and click Get changes .

Note: Before you complete this walkthrough, reset your environment to the base configuration. For more information, see Resetting your environment . The example provides a scripted mechanism to ingest data by using ETL toolkit. The script ingests data with and without correlation identifiers using both STANDARD and BULK import modes. For more information about ingestion, see: Information Store data ingestion Information Store data correlation To script the ingestion process, the following information is stored within the script: The mapping of item type identifiers to staging tables The mapping of staging tables to CSV files and format files. A list of import mapping identifiers from the mapping file. The script uses the runSqlServerCommandAsETL client function to import the data into the staging tables, and runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL to run the ingestion commands. Note the external ETL user is performing the import into the staging tables, but the i2 Internal ETL user is executing ETL tasks such as creating the ingestion source or performing the import from the staging tables. The data and ingestion artifacts that are used in the example are in the examples/data directory of the minimal toolkit. Creating the ingestion sources The runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL client function is used to run addInformationStoreIngestionSource ETL toolkit tool to create the ingestion sources. runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL addInformationStoreIngestionSource For more information about ingestion sources in the Information Store, see Defining an ingestion source For an example of how to use the tool, see the Create the ingestion sources section in the ingestDataWalkthrough.sh Creating the staging tables The runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL client function is used to run createInformationStoreStagingTable ETL toolkit tool to create the staging tables. runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL createInformationStoreStagingTable For more information about creating staging tables in the Information Store, see Creating the staging tables To create all of the staging tables in the example, schema type identifiers are mapped to staging table names. For an example of how the mappings are used, see the Create the staging tables section in the ingestDataWalkthrough.sh Note: Because there are multiple staging tables for the LAC1 link type, a second loop is used to iterate through the staging table names of each schema type. Ingesting data The walkthrough demonstrates how to ingest both non-correlated and correlated data. For each type of data the staging tables and populated, the data ingestion task is executed, then the staging tables are cleaned. Ingesting non correlated data In this case, the SQL Server BULK INSERT command is used to insert the CSV data into the staging tables. Ingesting correlated data See the Ingesting correlated data section of the walkthrough script. The ingestion procedure The runSqlServerCommandAsETL client function is used to run the sql statement that inserts the data into the staging tables. runSqlServerCommandAsETL Populating the staging tables The example uses CSV and format files to insert the data. The files have the same name ( person.csv and person.fmt ). The staging table names are mapped to the CSV and format files. There is one mapping for base data ( BASE_DATA_TABLE_TO_CSV_AND_FORMAT_FILE_NAME ) and one for correlation data ( CORRELATED_DATA_TABLE_AND_FORMAT_FILE_NAME ).

The repository is designed to be used with the i2 Analyze minimal toolkit. The minimal toolkit is similar to the standard i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, except that it only includes the minimum amount of application and configuration files. If you are already using the analyze-containers environment and want to upgrade to the latest versions, follow the instructions in Upgrading . Configuration development environment The process to deploy i2 Analyze in production is iterative, and includes a number of phases and environments. The containerized configuration development is designed so that it is easy to move between these stages. Because the environment is containerized, the provided scripts manage the creation of any containers that are required by the environment. For example, the database management system container is added to your environment when you specify a deployment pattern that includes it. You do not need to manually create it first. The following features of containerized configuration development environment are designed to enable you to develop i2 Analyze configurations: Simplified configuration directory The configuration directory structure is flattened to make it easier to locate files The directory includes placeholder configuration files so that you can add to existing files The XSD files are included to provide intellisense in VS Code Simplified deployment You can switch between i2 Analyze deployment patterns by changing a single setting.

    "keywords": "Backup This section describes the process to back up the Solr collections and the Information Store database in SQL Server in an i2 Analyze deployment in a containerised environment. Understanding the back up process In a deployment of i2 Analyze, data is stored in the Information Store database and indexed in Solr collections. You must back up these components as a pair to enable you to restore the data in your system after a failure. When you back up the Solr collections, the configuration in ZooKeeper is also backed up. To ensure that data can be restored correctly, you must back up the components in the following order: Solr collections Information Store database If data is changed in the database after taking the Solr backup, Solr can update the index to reflect these changes when the collections and database are restored. When you create your backups, ensure that you store both backups so that you can identify the pair of backups that you must restore if required. Note: In the walkthrough, both the database and Solr backups are versioned using the variable backup_version . In the walkthrough the backup version is 1 . This is used to create a directory where the all of the backup files are stored for this pair. To create another backup pair, increment the backup_version so that the backup files are stored in a different directory. Backing up the Solr collections To back up Solr collections, you must have a shared filesystem available that is shared and accessible by all Solr nodes. In a containerised environment, a backup volume is shared between all Solr containers. Note: In the example, the backup volume is mounted to /backup in the Solr container. To ensure solr can write the backup file, you must make sure the solr process has permission to the backup folder. In order for solr to write to the folder the user solr and group 0 must have read and write permission to the backup folder. The following chown command is an example that gives the solr process permission to write to the backup location: chown -R solr:0 /backup The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the BACKUP API request. The backup operation must be performed for each non-transient collection. The non-transient collections are the main_index , match_index , and chart_index . The following curl command is an example that creates a backup of the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983//solr/admin/collections?action=BACKUP&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1/ \" To perform a backup operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the backup API command, see BACKUP: Backup Collection Note: The BACKUP API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the backup procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Backing up Solr section of the walkthrough script. Determining status of Solr backup The Monitoring Solr backup process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsycRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous backup request. For more information about the client function, see getAsycRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr backup progress section of the walkthrough script. Backing up the system match rules file The system match rules are stored in the ZooKeeper configuration, and can be backed up by using the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) from the Solr client container. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli command. The following command is an example of how to use the getfile command to retrieve the system match rules: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr-8.8.2/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd getfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml Note: The system match rules file is backed up to the /backup/1/ folder where the Solr backup is located. For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . Backing up the Information Store database In the containerised environment, the mounted backup volume is used to store the backup file. Only the Information Store database is backed up. The SQL Server instance and system databases are not included in the backup. For more information about the backup volume, see Running a SQL Server . The backup is performed by a user that has the built-in db_backupoperator SQL Server role. In this case, that is the dbb user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsDBB client function to run the following SQL command to create the backup file. For example: runSQLServerCommandAsDBB bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"USE ISTORE; BACKUP DATABASE ISTORE TO DISK = '/backup/1/IStore.bak' WITH FORMAT;\\\"\" For more information about backing up a SQL Server database, see: Backup SQL Documentation SQL Server Backup Permissions For more information about the dbb user and it's role, see: db users See the Backing up SQL Server section of the walkthrough script."

    "keywords": "Restore This section describes the process to restore the Solr collections and Information Store database in SQL Server of an i2 Analyze deployment in a containerised environment. Understanding the restore process To restore the data and indexes for a deployment of i2 Analyze, restore the pair of Solr collection and Information Store database backups. To ensure that the data is restored correctly, restore the pair of backups in the following order: Information Store database Solr collections If any data has changed in the Information Store after the Solr backup, the Solr index is updated to reflect the contents of the Information Store database when Liberty is started. Preparing the environment Before you can restore the backups, clean down the Solr, ZooKeeper & SQL Server environment if you are not using a clean environment. See the Simulating Clean down section of the walkthrough script. Stop the liberty servers Before the restore process can begin you must stop the liberty servers. In a this can be done by stopping the containers The following command is an example of how to stop the liberty containers: docker container stop liberty1 liberty2 Restoring the Information Store database The process of restoring the Information Store database contains the following steps: Running a SQL Server container with a new instance of SQL Server Creating the Information Store database from the backup file in the new instance Recreating the required logins in the new SQL Server instance, and the users in the restored database Running a SQL Server container Run a container for the new instance of SQL Server, this will have the backup directory available. For more information about running a SQL Server container, see SQL Server . See the Running the SQL Server section of the walkthrough script. Creating the database from the backup file In a new instance of SQL Server, the only user is the sa user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function to run the following SQL command as the sa user to create the ISTORE database from the backup file: runSQLServerCommandAsSA bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"RESTORE DATABASE ISTORE FROM DISK = '/backup/IStore.bak;'\" See the Restoring the ISTORE database section of the walkthrough script. Recreating the logins and users In SQL Server, a login is scoped to the Database Engine. To connect to a specific database, in this case the ISTORE database, a login must be mapped to a database user. Because the backup is completed for the ISTORE database only, the logins from the previous SQL Server instance cannot be restored. Additionally, the database users are restored but there are no logins mapped to them. For more information about SQL Server logins, see SQL Server Login documentation In this environment, create the required logins and users by dropping the users from the database and recreating the logins and the users by using the createDbLoginAndUser client function. The logins and users are created in the same way as when original SQL Server instance was configured. For more information about creating the required logins, users, and permissions, see Configuring SQL Server in the deployment documentation. See the Dropping existing database users and Recreating database logins, users, and permissions sections of the walkthrough script. Restoring the Solr collections Restoring the solr indexes includes the following high-level steps: Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble Restore the non-transient Solr collections Monitor the restore process until completed Recreate transient Solr collections Restore system match rules Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble To restore the Solr indexes, deploy a new Solr cluster & ZooKeeper ensemble. For more information about running a clean ZooKeeper & Solr environment, see Running Solr and ZooKeeper . Create Solr cluster . See the Deploying Clean Solr & Zookeeper section of the walkthrough script. Restoring the non-transient Solr collections The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the RESTORE API request. The restore operation must be performed for each non-transient collection that was backed up. The following curl command is an example that restores the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=RESTORE&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1\" \" To perform a restore operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the Restore API command, see RESTORE: Restore Collection . Note: The restore API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the restore procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Restoring non-transient Solr collection section of the walkthrough script. Determining completion of Solr restore procedure The Monitoring Solr restore process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsycRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous request. For more information about the client function, see getAsycRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr restore progress section of the walkthrough script. Recreate transient Solr collections Recreate the transient daod_index and highlightquery_index Solr collections. For more information about the creating Solr collections, see Configuring Solr and ZooKeeper . See the Recreating transient Solr collections section of the walkthrough script. Restore system match rules After the indexes are restored, upload the system match rules file. Use the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) to create the directory in ZooKeeper for the system match rules file and to upload it. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli request. The following command creates the directory in ZooKeeper where the system match rules file must be stored: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr-8.8.2/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd makepath /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app Note: The path to where the system match rules file must be located is in the following format configs/<index name>/<index name>/app The following command uploads the system match rules file to the directory in ZooKeeper created earlier: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr-8.8.2/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd putfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . See the Restoring system match rules section of the walkthrough script. Start the Liberty containers After the Solr collections and Information Store database are restored, start the Liberty containers. The following command is an example of how to start the Liberty containers: docker container start liberty1 liberty2 After the Liberty containers have started, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceToBeLive common function ensures that the i2 Analyze service is running. See the Restart Liberty containers section of the walkthrough script."

For example: DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN=\"i2c_istore\" Process overview: Create a custom connector image Update the configuration to reference connectors Build connector images and redeploy Creating a connector image Create a connector image from one of the image templates. You can deploy connectors using the following templates: Spring Boot for Java based connectors i2 Connect server for Node based connectors developed using the i2 Connect server SDK NodeJS for Node based connectors External for connectors hosted outside of the config development environment The connector should be secured and run on port 3443 . For more information about securing your system, see Securing i2 Analyze . Spring Boot based connector image Copy the /templates/springboot-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the springboot-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - target - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy your connector code into the target directory of the connector directory. For example, copy your .jar file into the <connector_name>/target directory. Next, configure your connector . i2 Connect server based connector image Copy the /templates/i2connect-server-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the i2connect-server-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - app - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy the i2 Connect server connector distributable ( the .tar.gz or .tgz file) into the connector directory. Next, configure your connector . NodeJS based connector image Copy the /templates/node-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the node-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - app - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy your connector code into the app directory of the connector directory. For example, copy the files into the <connector_name>/app directory. By default, the image will start node with the file app.js . Next, configure your connector . External connector Copy the /templates/external-connector directory to the /connector-images directory. Rename the external-connector folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - connector-definition.json Next, configure your connector . Configuring a connector Populate the values in the <connector_name>/connector-definition.json file with information about your connector. Key Description id An identifier that is unique for all connectors that will be deployed. name A name for the connector that is displayed to users in the client. configurationPath The full path to the configuration endpoint of the connector. By default, it is /config . gatewaySchema The short name of an optional gateway schema. When no gateway schema is used, do not provide a value. type Used to identify the type of connector. For i2 Connect server connectors, set to i2connect-server . For external connectors, set to external . For any other connectors, the type key is not required. baseUrl Used only for connectors of type external . The baseUrl value is the URL address of the connector. For any other connectors, the baseUrl key is not required. For example: { \"id\": \"connector1\", \"name\": \"Connector 1\", \"description\": \"First connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template-schema\", \"type\": \"i2connect-server\" } or { \"id\": \"connector2\", \"name\": \"Connector 2\", \"description\": \"Second connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template-schema\", \"type\": \"external\", \"baseUrl\": \"https://example-connector:3443\" } Note: If your external connector is hosted in a Docker container on a different network to your config development environment, connect the Liberty container to the same network as your external connector container. For example, run docker network connect <connector-network-name> liberty1.<config-name> . If your connector is running on your host machine, use the IP address of your host machine in the baseUrl value. Provide the version of the connector in the <connector_name>/connector-version.json file. For external connectors, this file is not required. The version value specifies the version of the connector. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"0-0-1\" } For more information about configuring connectors, see Managing connectors . Adding connectors to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your connector with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file and add the directory name for your connector in the connectors array. For example, to add the connector in connector-images\\example-connector the connector-references.json file contains the following connectors array: { \"connectors\": [ { \"name\": \"example-connector\" } ], ... } Defining a gateway schema (Optional) You can develop the gateway schema and associated charting schemes by changing the deployment pattern to schema-dev and following the instructions in Developing schemas in your configuration development environment . After you develop the schemes, complete the following steps to add deploy them with your configuration: Copy the schema and charting scheme files to the /gateway-schemas directory. To define the short name of the gateway schema, the prefix of the file name is used. The convention is defined as: <short>-<name>-schema.xml and <short>-<name>-schema-charting-scheme.xml . For example, files with the names law-enforcement-schema.xml and law-enforcement-charting-schemes.xml have the short name law-enforcement . Add the short name of your schema to the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file in the gatewaySchemas array. For example, to add a gateway schema with the short name law-enforcement , the file contains the following gatewaySchemas array: { ... ], \"gatewaySchemas\": [ { \"shortName\": \"law-enforcement\" } ] } Set the short name of your schema in the <connector_name>/connector-definition.json as the value for the gatewaySchema key of the connector that will use the gateway schema. Building the connector images and redeploying Run the ./deploy.sh script with your config name and the connectors task from the /scripts directory to generate the secrets for your connectors, build the connector images, and deploy your environment. ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t connectors After you add connectors to your environment, you can configure the rest of the configuration ."

The following information describes how you can use the config development environment to quickly deploy an extension for a config to test and develop. For more information about the types of extension that are available, see IBM i2 Analyze Developer Essentials . Prerequisites Install the Java Extension Pack in VS Code. Ensure to have the correct JDK configured: Run the Java Configuration Wizard by pressing F1 and typing Java: Configure Java Runtime . Install temurin 11 JDK if it isn't already installed in your machine. Install Maven. For more information about installing Maven, see Installing Apache Maven . Modify the VS Code settings.json file: Open the settings.json file by pressing F1 and typing Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) . Add the classpath information to deploy extensions. In the settings.json file , add the following object: \"java.project.referencedLibraries\": [ \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/shared/lib/*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/disco-api-*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/solr-core-*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/solr-solrj-*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/Daod.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/httpclient-*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/httpcore-*.jar\", \"pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/application/targets/opal-services/WEB-INF/lib/ApolloLegacy.jar\" ] Creating a project for your extension You must create a Maven artifact to develop your extension in. Copy the template templates/extension-development directory to the i2a-extensions directory and rename it to be the name of your extension. This name is also the artifact id. For example, name the directory opal-default-security-example . The directory structure is: - i2a-extensions - <artifact_id> - src - main - java - test - java - pom.xml Update the pom.xml file inside your new directory with information about your extension. The elements to modify are at the root of the file. Update the values of the following elements: <groupId> is the name of the Java package <artifactId> matches the name of the directory for your extension <version> is the version number for your extension For example: <groupId>com.i2group</groupId> <artifactId>opal-default-security-example</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> You can now start developing your extension. For examples on i2 Analyze extensions, check the examples in IBM i2 Analyze Developer Essentials . Copy the contents of src/main folder of the extension into the i2a-extensions/<artifact_id>/src/main directory. Add any settings that are required by the extension to the analyze-settings.properties file. Add any resources that are required by the extension to the /configs/<config_name>/configuration directory. For example, the group-based-default-security-dimension-values.xml file. If your extension depends on another extension. You must add it to your pom.xml file under the comment: <!-- Extension specific dependencies --> . For example, the auditing extensions in Developer Essentials depend on the opal-audit-example-common extension. To add it as a dependency, populate the values of the pom.xml file as follows: <!-- Extension specific dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>com.i2group</groupId> <artifactId>opal-audit-example-common</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> </dependency> Adding extensions to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your extension with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/extension-references.json file and add the directory name for your extension in the extensions array. For example, to add the extension in i2a-extensions/opal-default-security-example the extension-references.json file contains the following extensions array: { \"extensions\": [ { \"name\": \"opal-default-security-example\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" } ] } Note: The extensions in the extension-references.json file are loaded in order. If an extension depends on another extension, define the dependent extension first. Deploying your extension Use the deploy.sh script with the extensions task to build the extensions for your configuration. For example, to build and deploy the extensions declared in extension-references.json for your configuration: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t extensions If you do not want to build and run all of the declared extensions, you can use the -i and -e options to include or exclude extensions from the process. For example, to build and run only the extensions named opal-default-security-example and opal-default-security-example-2 : ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t extensions -i opal-default-security-example -i opal-default-security-example-2 Debugging your extension Deploying in debug mode To deploy with one or more Liberty servers running in debug mode, change the local variable DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS in utils/internalHelperVariables.sh to be a list of the container names of the liberty servers you wish to run in debug mode. For example: DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS=(\"${LIBERTY1_CONTAINER_NAME}\") Then deploy from a clean environment. When the Liberty servers start they all wait for a debugger to be attached before continuing. Note: Each Liberty server will open and expose a unique debug port (starting at port 7777) and wait for a debugger. This behaviour is defined by the WLP_DEBUG_SUSPEND environment variable in the liberty container and could be changed if needed. Attaching a debugger The project is shipped with a default launch configuration which can be changed in .vscode/launch.json . Run the Java debugger by pressing F5 and choose Debug Extensions if asked."

This section also describes the messages that you should monitor to detect the failure and ensure that the recovery was successful. Before you begin the walkthrough, there are a number of concepts that it is useful to understand: How Liberty is deployed for high availability and the role of the Liberty leader. For more information about Liberty configuration, see Liberty . How a load balancer is used and configured in a deployment of i2 Analyze. For more information about the load balancer configuration, see Deploying a load balancer . That the load balancer is used to monitor the status of the i2 Analyze service. In a containerised deployment, all log messages are also displayed in the console. You can use the docker logs command to view the console log. The libertyHadrFailureWalkthrough.sh script simulates the Liberty leader failure. Identifying the leader Liberty To simulate a failure of the leader Liberty, first identify which server hosts the leader instance. To identify which container is running the leader Liberty, check the logs of the Liberty servers for the message: We are the Liberty leader . In the walkthrough script, this is done with the following grep command: grep -q \"We are the Liberty leader\" See the Identifying the leader Liberty section of the walkthrough script. Simulating leader Liberty failure To simulate leader Liberty failure, stop the leader Liberty. For example, if liberty1 is the leader, run: docker stop liberty1 See the Simulating leader Liberty failure section of the walkthrough script. Detecting failure The load balancer is used to monitor and determine the status of the i2 Analyze service. The load balancer is configured to report the status of the deployment. The status can be either ACTIVE , DEGRADED , or DOWN . When the leader is taken offline, the other Liberty server must restart to become the new leader. During this time, both servers are down and the i2 Analyze service is DOWN . When the new leader Liberty starts and only 1 of the servers is down, the status of the i2 Analyze services is DEGRADED . In the walkthrough, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is used to run a while loop around the geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function to wait until the i2 Analyze service is in the DEGRADED state. The geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is an example of how to return the i2 Analyze service status from a load balancer. See the Detecting failure section of the walkthrough script. Fail over When the Liberty leader fails, one of the remaining Liberty servers is elected as the leader. To identify the new Liberty leader, check the logs of the remaining Liberty servers for the message: We are the Liberty leader . See the Fail over section of the walkthrough script. Reinstating high availability To reinstate high availability to the deployment, restart the failed Liberty server. In this example, that restart the Liberty container by running the following command: docker start liberty1 When both Liberty servers are up, the status of the i2 Analyze services is ACTIVE . In the walkthrough, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is used to run a while loop around the geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function to wait until the i2 Analyze service is in the ACTIVE state. The geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is an example of how to return the i2 Analyze service status from a load balancer. The recovered Liberty server is in the non-leader mode when it starts because the new leader has already been elected while the server was unavailable. To determine it is in the non-leader mode, the following message is displayed in the logs: We are not the Liberty leader . See the Reinstating high availability section of the walkthrough script."

    "keywords": "Liberty In a containerized deployment, you configure the i2 Analyze application and Liberty in an image that is layered on top of the liberty_ubi_base image. The liberty_ubi_base contains static configuration and application jars that are required by i2 Analyze and should not be changed. Configuring the Liberty server Liberty is configured by exception. The runtime environment operates from a set of built-in configuration default settings, and you only need to specify configuration that overrides those default settings. You do this by editing either the server.xml file or another XML file that is included in server.xml at run time. In a containerized deployment of i2 Analyze, a server.xml file is provided for you. To provide or modify any values, you specify a number of environment variables when you run a Liberty container. Additionally, you can extend the server.xml by using the provided server.extensions.xml in the i2 Analyze configuration. Any elements that you add to the extensions file are included in the server.xml when you run a Liberty container. Configuring the i2 Analyze application The contents of the configuration directory must be copied into the images/liberty_ubi_combined/classes directory. The contents of the classes directory is added to the configured Liberty image when the image is built. If you make changes to the configuration, you must copy the changes to the classes directory and rebuild the configured image. Note: The system match rules are configured differently. The application is updated to use the system-match-rules.xml from the Solr client command line. For more information about updating the system match rules, see Updating the system match rules . Building a configured Liberty image The configured image is built from the base image. The configured image contains the i2 Analyze application and Liberty configuration that is required to start the i2 Analyze application. When you change the configuration, the configured image must be rebuilt to reflect the changes. Docker build command The configured image is built from the Dockerfile in images/liberty_ubi_combined . The following docker build command builds the configured image: docker build -t \"liberty_configured_redhat:4.3.4\" images/liberty_ubi_combined --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=\"liberty_redhat:4.3.4\" An example of providing the configuration to the classes directory and building the image is included in the buildLibertyConfiguredImage function in the serverFunctions.sh script. Running a Liberty container A Liberty container uses the configured image. In the docker run command, you can use -e to pass environment variables to Liberty on the container. The environment variables are described in environment variables For more information about the command, see docker run reference . Docker run command The following docker run command runs a Liberty container: docker run -m 1g -d \\ --name \"liberty1\" \\ --network \"eia\" \\ --net-alias \"liberty1.eia\" \\ -p \"9045:9443\" \\ -v \"liberty1_secrets:/run/secrets\" \\ -v \"liberty1_data:/data\" \\ -e LICENSE=\"accept\" \\ -e FRONT_END_URI=\"https://liberty.eia:9045/opal\" \\ -e DB_DIALECT=\"sqlserver\" \\ -e DB_SERVER=\"sqlserver.eia\" \\ -e DB_PORT=1433 \\ -e DB_USERNAME=\"i2analyze\" \\ -e DB_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/DB_PASSWORD\" \\ -e ZK_HOST=\"zk1.eia:2281,zk2.eia:2281,zk3.eia:2281\" \\ -e ZOO_DIGEST_USERNAME=\"solr\" \\ -e ZOO_DIGEST_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/ZK_DIGEST_PASSWORD\" \\ -e SOLR_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_USER=\"liberty\" \\sp -e SOLR_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/SOLR_APPLICATION_DIGEST_PASSWORD\" \\ -e DB_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SERVER_SSL=true \\ -e SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=\"/run/secrets/server.key\" \\ -e SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/server.cer\" \\ -e SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/CA.cer\" \\ -e GATEWAY_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=\"/run/secrets/gateway_user.key\" \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/gateway_user.cer\" \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/outbound_CA.cer\" \\ -e LIBERTY_HADR_MODE=1 \\ -e LIBERTY_HADR_POLL_INTERVAL=1 \\ liberty_configured_redhat For an example of the docker run command, see serverFunctions.sh . The runLiberty function takes the following arguments to support running multiple Liberty containers: CONTAINER - The name for the container. FQDN - The fully qualified domain name for the container and the Solr host. VOLUME - the name for the named volume of the Liberty container. For more information, see Volumes . HOST_PORT - The port number on the host machine that is mapped to the port on the container. KEY_FOLDER - The folder with keys and certificates for the container. For more information, see Security . An example of running Liberty container by using runLiberty function: runLiberty liberty1 liberty1.eia liberty1_data 9045 liberty1 Volumes A named volume is used to persist data, which is generated and used in the Liberty container, outside of the container. To configure the Liberty container to use the volume, specify the -v option with the name of the volume and the path where the directory is mounted in the container. By setting -v option in the docker run command, a named volume is created. For Liberty, the directory that is mounted must be /data , this directory folder stores: jobs, record groups and charts. For example: -v liberty_data:/data \\ -v liberty1_secrets:/run/secrets Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access ZooKeeper, the database, and the certificates used in SSL. The directory is used to update the named volume location defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as ZOO_DIGEST_USERNAME_FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. Environment variables To configure the Liberty server, you provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. The following table describes the supported environment variables that you can use: Environment variable Description FRONT_END_URI The URI that clients use to connect to i2 Analyze. For more information, see Specifying the connection URI . DB_DIALECT Specifies which database management system to configure i2 Analyze for. In this release, it can be set to sqlserver .

Docker run command The following docker run command starts a ZooKeeper container: docker run --restart always -d \\ --name \"zk1\" \\ --net \"eia\" \\ --net-alias \"zk1.eia\" \\ -p \"8080:8080\" \\ -p \"2181:2181\" \\ -p \"2281:2281\" \\ -p \"3888:3888\" \\ -p \"2888:2888\" \\ -v \"zk1_data:/data\" \\ -v \"zk1_datalog:/datalog\" \\ -v \"zk1_logs:/logs\" \\ -v \"zk1_secrets:/run/secrets\" \\ -e \"ZOO_SERVERS=server.1=zk1.eia:2888:3888 server.2=zk2.eia:2888:3888 server.3=zk3.eia:2888:3888\" \\ -e \"ZOO_MY_ID=1\" \\ -e \"ZOO_SECURE_CLIENT_PORT=2281\" \\ -e \"ZOO_CLIENT_PORT=2181\" \\ -e \"ZOO_4LW_COMMANDS_WHITELIST=ruok, mntr, conf\" \\ -e \"SERVER_SSL=true\" \\ -e \"SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/server.key\" \\ -e \"SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/run/secrets/server.cer\" \\ -e \"SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/run/secrets/CA.cer\" \\ \"zookeeper_redhat:4.3.4\" Note: SERVER_SSL variable is set based on the SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION switch, see Environment variables . ​ZooKeeper Service Ports Default ports used by ZooKeeper are: 8080 - By default, the server is started on port 8080, and commands are issued by going to the URL \"/commands/[command name]\", e.g., http://localhost:8080/commands/stat . 2181 - The port at which the clients will connect (non-secure). This is defined by setting ZOO_CLIENT_PORT . 2281 - The port at which the clients will connect (secure). This is defined by setting ZOO_SECURE_CLIENT_PORT . 3888 - Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other. 2888 - Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other. For more information, see ZooKeeper Service Ports . For an example of the docker run command, see serverFunctions.sh . The runZK function takes the following arguments to support running multiple ZooKeeper containers: CONTAINER - The name for the container. FQDN - The fully qualified domain name for the container. DATA_VOLUME - The name for the data named volume. For more information, see Volumes . DATALOG_VOLUME - The name for the datalog named volume. For more information, see Volumes . LOG_VOLUME - The name for the log named volume. For more information, see Volumes . HOST_PORT - The port number on the host machine that is mapped to the port on the container. ZOO_ID - An identifier for the ZooKeeper server. For more information, see Environment variables . An example of running Zookeeper container using runZK function: runZK zk1 zk1.eia zk1_data zk1_datalog zk1_logs 8080 1 Volumes A named volume or a bind mount can be used to persist data and logs that are generated and used in the ZooKeeper container, outside of the container. For more information, see Where to store data . Named Volumes To configure the ZooKeeper container to use the named volume, specify the -v option with the name of the volume and the path where the directory is mounted in the container. By setting -v option in the docker run command, a named volume is created. For ZooKeeper, the directories that must be mounted are /data , /datalog , /logs . For example: -v zk1_data:/data \\ -v zk1_datalog:/datalog \\ -v zk1_log:/logs \\ -v zk1_secrets:/run/secrets A unique volume name must be used for each ZooKeeper container. A bind mount can be used instead of the named volume: For example: -v /var/zk/data:/data \\ -v /var/zk/datalog:/datalog \\ -v /var/zk/logs:/logs \\ A unique bind mount must be used for each ZooKeeper container. Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access zookeeper and certificates used in SSL. The directory is used to update the named volume location defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. Environment variables To configure ZooKeeper, you can provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. The zoo.cfg configuration file for ZooKeeper is generated from the environment variables passed to the container. The following table describes the mandatory environment variables for running ZooKeeper in replicated mode: Environment variable Description ZOO_SERVERS Specified the list of ZooKeeper servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble. Servers are specified in the following format: server.id=<address1>:<port1>:<port2>;<client port> . ZOO_MY_ID An identifier for the ZooKeeper server. The identifier must be unique within the ensemble. ZOO_CLIENT_PORT Specifies the port number for client connections. Maps to the clientPort configuration parameter. ZOO_4LW_COMMANDS_WHITELIST A list of comma separated Four Letter Words commands that user wants to use. A valid Four Letter Words command must be put in this list else ZooKeeper server will not enable the command. By default the whitelist only contains \"srvr\" command which zkServer.sh uses. The rest of four letter word commands are disabled by default. For more information, see ZooKeeper Docker hub . The following table described the security environment variables: Environment variable Description ZOO_SECURE_CLIENT_PORT Specifies the port number for client connections that use SSL. Maps to the secureClientPort configuration parameter. SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION See Secure Environment variables . SERVER_SSL See Secure Environment variables .

Maps to the tickTime configuration parameter. The default value is 2000 . ZOO_INIT_LIMIT Amount of time, in ticks, to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader. Increase this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large. Maps to the initLimit configuration parameter. The default value is 10 . ZOO_SYNC_LIMIT Amount of time, in ticks, to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper. If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped. Maps to the syncLimit configuration parameter. The default value is 5 . ZOO_AUTOPURGE_PURGEINTERVAL The time interval in hours for which the purge task has to be triggered. Set to a positive integer (1 and above) to enable the auto purging. Maps to the autopurge.purgeInterval configuration parameter. The default value is 24 . ZOO_AUTOPURGE_SNAPRETAINCOUNT When auto purge is enabled, ZooKeeper retains the specified number of most recent snapshots and the corresponding transaction logs in the dataDir and dataLogDir respectively and deletes the rest. Maps to the autopurge.snapRetainCount setting. The default value is 3 . ZOO_MAX_CLIENT_CNXNS Limits the number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a single client, identified by IP address, may make to a single member of the ZooKeeper ensemble. Maps to the maxClientCnxns configuration parameter. The default value is 60 . ZOO_STANDALONE_ENABLED When set to true , if ZooKeeper is started with a single server the ensemble will not be allowed to grow, and if started with more than one server it will not be allowed to shrink to contain fewer than two participants. Maps to the standaloneEnabled configuration parameter. The default value is true . ZOO_ADMINSERVER_ENABLED Enables the AdminServer. The AdminServer is an embedded Jetty server that provides an HTTP interface to the four letter word commands. Maps to the admin.enableServer configuration parameter. The default value is true .

For example: DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN=\"i2c_istore\" Process overview: Provide a data set Create the ingestion sources Provide and run scripts to complete the ingestion process If you have deployed with the law enforcement schema, complete the steps in Example ingestion process to ingest example data into your Information Store. Data sets The /i2a-data directory is used to contain the data sets that you ingest into the Information Store of a deployment. The data that you ingest into the Information Store must conform to the Information Store schema. However, one data set can be ingested with different configs. There is not a 1-to-1 mapping between data sets and configs. Each data set must contain at least one ingestion script. This script contains the functions that populate the staging tables with your data and calls the ETL toolkit tools that ingest the data. The expected directory structure is as follows: - i2a-data - <data_set> - scripts - <script1> - <script2> Ingesting data into the config dev environment The manageData.sh script is used to manage the ingestion process in the dev environment. To ingest data into the Information Store, you must create scripts that call the ETL tools that complete the actions required by i2 Analyze for you ingest data. For more information, see: ETL tools Ingesting data into the Information Store You can find example scripts in the examples/ingestion/scripts directory. These scripts demonstrate how to create staging tables, populate them, and ingest the data into the Information Store. To run scripts, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t ingest -d <data_set> -s <script_name> Where: <config_name> is the name of the config that is currently deployed and running in the config dev environment <data_set> is the name of a directory in i2a-data <script_name> is the name of a script in the directory specified for <data_set> Creating ingestion sources The ingestion sources for a config are contained in the configuration. Ingestion sources are defined in <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh . Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh file to the <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/ directory. In the script, the INGESTION_SOURCES array contains the name and description of 2 example sources. INGESTION_SOURCES=( [Example Ingestion Source 1]=EXAMPLE_1 [Example Ingestion Source 2]=EXAMPLE_2 ) You can modify or add to the array of ingestion sources. To create the ingestion sources in the array, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t sources Example ingestion process The i2 Analyze minimal toolkit contains the example law-enforcement-data-set-1 data that can be ingested when the example law enforcement schema ( law-enforcement-schema.xml ) is deployed. This contains a number of CSV files that contain the data, and a mapping.xml file. For more information about the mapping file, see Ingestion mapping files . Before you can ingest the law enforcement example data, complete the following steps to provide the data set and scripts: Copy the pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory to the i2a-data directory. Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts directory to the i2a-data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory.

The complete contents of each connector directory depends on the template that you used to create it. All the templates include a folder that you use to place the connector source code, the files used to build the Docker images and run the Docker containers, and JSON files that you use to provide information about the connector. For instructions about how to add connectors to your environment, see Adding connectors to your development environment . Connector versioning You specify the version and tag of a connector in the connector-version.json file of each connector. version The version value is used as a version for your connector. If you are deploying an i2 Connect server connector, the version value has more requirements. For more information, see i2 Connect server connector versioning . tag The tag value is used in the image name, host name, and secrets for your connector container. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"1-0-0\" } Building connectors Use the deploy.sh script with the connectors task to generate secrets and build the images for all connectors. You can specify connector names to build a subset of the connectors in your environment. For example, to build and run all of the connectors in the connector-images directory: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t connectors If you do not want to build and run all of the connectors, you can use the -i and -e options to include or exclude connectors from the process. For example, to build and run only the connectors named example-connector and example-connector-2 : ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t connectors -i example-connector -i example-connector-2 Connector secrets Before you can use a connector, you must generate secrets for it. For more information about the secrets used in the environment, see Managing container security . The secrets that are generated for a particular connector are tied to the tag, if you change the tag you must to regenerate the secrets for that connector. To regenerate the secrets for a connector after you change the tag, complete the following steps: Remove the dev-environment-secrets/<connector_name> directory for the connector that you changed the tag of. Run the deploy.sh script and specify the connector name to regenerate the secrets, rebuild the image, and deploy the environment. For example: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t connectors -i <connector_name> Note: To secure the connection to an external connector, you must install the following certificates where the connector is running. At this release, your connector must be configured to use the certificates signed by the config development environment CA. dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/<connector-name>/server.key dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/<connector-name>/server.cer dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/certificates/CA/CA.cer i2 Connect server connectors If you are deploying one or more connectors that were developed using the i2 Connect SDK. There are two versions that you must consider; the version of a connector and the version of the i2 Connect server that the connectors depends on. Connector version In the connector-version.json file, the version specifies the range of supported versions for the connector. This enables you to have more control of the version of a connector that is used in your deployment. You can specify the range of versions at the major, minor, or patch level. For example, if you specify a major version 1 in the connector-version.json file, any connector that has a major version of 1 is compatible. When the connector is developed, the version of the connector is provided in the package.json file by the developer. If the version of the connector specified in package.json does not match the version, or range of versions, that you specify in connector-version.json a warning is displayed when you deploy your environment. The following table demonstrates how you can specify the version ranges and their compatibility with connector versions: package.json version connector-version.json version Compatible?

When the connector is developed, the version of the i2 Connect server that the connector depends on is provided in the package.json file by the developer. In the connector-images/i2connect-server-version.json file, you specify the range of versions of the i2 Connect server that you want all i2 Connect server connectors to depend on. The versions in these files are specified in the npm semantic versioning syntax. For more information about the syntax, see semver - the semantic versioning for npm . If the version of the i2 Connect server that a connector depends on specified in package.json does not match the version, or range of versions, that you specify in i2connect-server-version.json a warning is displayed when you deploy your environment.

    "title": "Synchronize configurations",
    "keywords": "Synchronize configurations You can synchronize configurations between the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and the configuration development environment. This enables you to develop the i2 Analyze configuration by using the config development environment, and deploy with it as part of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. This can be useful in the following situations: You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration. When you synchronize a configuration, you must do so with a complete i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. You can synchronize from an existing deployment toolkit configuration (import) or from an existing configuration development config (export). The configuration from the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit is the source of truth. When you have an existing deployment toolkit, the instructions direct you to back up the configuration before you synchronize it with the config development environment. You complete the synchronization by using the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script. Examples The following use cases demonstrate the process of synchronizing configurations between the config development environment and an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit: Use case 1 : You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. Use case 2 : You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to convert to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration. After you develop the configuration, you will still deploy i2 Analyze using the deployment toolkit. Use case 1 Use the config development environment to create and develop a config. For more information, see Configuration development environment . When you are happy with the developed configuration, you can complete the process that enables you to use it with the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Install the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. For more information, see Installing i2 Analyze . Export the configuration from the config development environment to the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the create task to create a base configuration in the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t create Where: -c is the name of the config. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was installed in step 2. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. Note: The base configuration that is created is suitable for the deployment pattern that is specified in the variables.sh file of the specified config. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task to export the config dev configuration into the deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the name of the config to export. -p is the full path to the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was installed in step 2. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. You can then deploy your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . Start at step 3 from the linked documentation. There are a number of environment specific configuration files that are not populated in the config development environment. Use case 2 This section assumes that you are starting with a configuration from an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . The config development environment uses fixed names for schemas and configuration files. Before you can import you deployment toolkit configuration into the config development environment, your configuration must be updated to use the expected file names. The manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script can rename the files for you and update any references to them. You can also decide whether or not to use the config development environment configuration set in your deployment toolkit configuration. If you decide to use the new config set, all settings for the deployment must be specified in the analyze-settings.properties file. If you choose not to use the new configuration set, any additions that you make to the analyze-settings file in the config development environment are not exported. Back up your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. Fore more information about backing up your configuration, see Back up and restore the configuration . Use the config development environment to create an empty config to import your configuration in to. For more information, see Configuration development environment . You do not need to specify any schema files or deploy the config. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the prepare task to rename the schema and configuration files and update the references: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t prepare Where: -c is the config name you are working with. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. To use the config development environment configuration set, complete the following 2 steps. Otherwise, move to step 5. Copy the contents of templates/toolkit-config-mod directory to the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes directory of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Review the settings that are used in the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files of i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and move any settings that you want to continue using into the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes/analyze-settings.properties file. You can remove the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files after you move any settings. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the import task to import the configuration into the config development environment: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t import Where: -c is the config name to import the configuration into. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. Use the config development environment to develop the configuration. For more information, see Developing the configuration . In the config development environment, a user.registry.xml is required. You can start from the example provided in pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/security and align it to your security schema or copy in an existing one. If you want to use your developed configuration in your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, you can use the export task to export the configuration into your toolkit. Otherwise, continue to use the config development environment. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task. For example: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the config name you have created to synchronize the configuration to. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. You must update the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit deployment with the changes to the configuration. Connectors In the config development environment, i2 Connect connectors are run on Docker images and can only be access from within the Docker network.

    "keywords": "Database roles, users, and logins During the deployment, administration, and use of i2 Analyze, a number of different actions are completed against the Information Store database. These actions can be separated into different categories that are usually completed by users with differing permissions. In SQL Server, you can create a number of database roles and assign users to roles. In the example deployment, a number of different roles and users are used to demonstrate the types of roles that might complete each action. Database roles In the example, the following roles are used: Role Description DBA_Role The DBA_Role is used to perform database administrative tasks. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role is used to move data from an external system into the staging tables in the Information Store database. i2_ETL_Role The i2_ETL_Role is used to read data from the staging tables and ingest it into - and delete it from - the Information Store database. i2analyze_Role The i2analyze_Role is used to complete actions required by the Liberty application. For example, returning results for Visual Queries. Database role permissions Each database role requires a specific set of permissions to complete the actions attributed to them. DBA_Role The DBA_Role requires permissions to: Set up and maintain the database management system and Information Store database. Create and modify the database management system objects. For example, bufferpools, tablespaces, and filegroups. Create and modify database objects. For example, tables, views, indexes, sequences. Troubleshoot performance or other issues. For example, has all privileges on all tables. This can be restricted in some environments. Configure high availability. Manage backup and recovery activities. Additionally, the role requires access to two roles in the msdb database: SQLAgentUserRole - for more information, see SQLAgentUserRole Permissions db_datareader - for more information, see Fixed-Database Roles These roles are required for database creation, to initialize the deletion-by-rule objects, and to create the SQL Server Agent jobs for the deletion rules. Note: The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is run during deploy to grant the correct permissions. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes All CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM Required to create the database objects. All ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, REFERENCES Required to make changes for maintaining the database. IS_Core EXECUTE Required for deletion-by-rule and database configuration. IS_Public EXECUTE Required to run the stored procedures for deletion-by-rule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the msdb database: Schema Permissions Notes dbo SQLAgentUserRole Required to create the deletion jobs during deployment, and to manage the deletion job schedule. dbo db_datareader Required to create the deletion job schedule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the master database: Schema Permissions Notes All VIEW SERVER STATE Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs via the SQL Server Agent. sys EXECUTE ON fn_hadr_is_primary_replica Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs. The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is used to configure the DBA user with all the required role memberships and permissions. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role requires permissions to move data from external systems into the Information Store staging tables. For example, it can be used by an ETL tool - such as DataStage or Informatica - to move and transform data that results in populated staging tables in the Information Store staging schema. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to populate the staging tables with date to be ingested or deleted. In addition to these permissions, in an environment running SQL server in a Linux container, users with this role must also be a member of the sysadmin group in order to perform BULK INSERT into the external staging tables. The addEtlUserToSysAdminRole.sh script is used to make the etl user a member of the sysadmin fixed-server role. i2_ETL_Role The i2_ETL_Role requires permissions to use the i2 Analyze ingestion tools to ingest data from the staging tables into the Information Store. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required by the ingestion tools to create and modify objects during the ingestion process. IS_Stg ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required by the ingestion tools to create and modify objects during the ingestion process. IS_Meta SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT UPDATE and INSERT are required to update the ingestion history table. SELECT is required to read the schema meta data. IS_Data ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ALTER is required to drop and create indexes and update statistics as part of the ingestion process. IS_Public ALTER, SELECT ALTER is required to delete and create synonyms when enabling merged property views. IS_Core SELECT, EXECUTE Required to check configuration of the database. i2analyze_Role The i2analyze_Role requires permissions to complete actions required by the Liberty application. These actions include: Visual Query, Find Path, Expand, Add to chart, Upload, and Online upgrade. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to run deletion-by-rule jobs. IS_Stg ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to upload and delete records via Analyst's Notebook Premium and to run deletion-by-rule jobs. IS_Meta SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE DELETE is required to process the ingestion history queue. IS_Data SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE are required by deletion-by-rule and to upload and delete records via Analyst's Notebook Premium. IS_Core SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required for online upgrade. IS_VQ SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to complete Visual Queries. IS_FP SELECT, INSERT, EXEC Required to complete Find Path operations. IS_WC SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to work with Web Charts. The database backup operator role The example also demonstrates how to perform a database backup. The dbb user will perform this action and is a member of the SQL Server built-in role, db_backupoperator . This gives this user the correct permissions for performing a backup and nothing else. For more information, see Fixed-Database Roles for more details. Database users and logins In the example, a user is created for each role described previously. These users are then used throughout the deployment and administration steps to provide a reference for when each role is required. The following users and logins are used in the example: User and login Description Secrets sa The system administrator user. The sa user has full permissions on the database instance. This user creates the Information Store database, roles, users, and logins. The password is in the SA_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the SA_USERNAME file in the secrets/sqlserver directory. i2analyze The i2analyze user is a member of the i2analyze_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/liberty directory. etl The etl user is a member of External_ETL_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/etl directory. i2etl The i2etl user is a member of i2_ETL_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/i2etl directory. dba The dba user is a member of DBA_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/dba directory. dbb The dbb user is the database backup user, it is a member of the SQL Server built in role: db_backupoperator . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/dbb directory. The sa user and login exists on the base SQL Server image. The sa user is used to create the following artefacts: Database: ISTORE Roles: i2analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role, , i2_ETL_Role and DBA_Role Logins: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb Users: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb The roles and users must be created after the Information Store database is created. Creating the roles The sa user is used to run the createDbRoles.sh client function that creates the i2Analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role , i2_ETL_Role , and DBA_Role roles. To create the roles, the createDbRoles.sh script is run using the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function. This function uses an ephemeral SQL Server client container to create the database roles. For more information about the client function, see: runSQLServerCommandAsSA createDbRoles.sh All the secrets required at runtime by the client container are made available by providing a file path to the secret which is converted to an environment variable by the docker container. For example, to provide the SA_USERNAME environment variable to the client container, a file containing the secret is declared in the docker run command: -e \"SA_USERNAME_FILE=${CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR}/SA_USERNAME_FILE\" The file name can be anything, but the environment variable is fixed. For more information see, managing container security In the example, the createDbRoles.sh script is called in deploy.sh . Create the login and user Use the sa user to create the login and the user on the ISTORE , and make the user a member of the role. You can use an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the login and the user. The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script in /images/sql_client/db-scripts is used to create the login and user. The scripts are called from the deploy.sh scripts. The createDbLoginAndUser function The createDbLoginAndUser function uses an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the database administrator login and user. The login and user are created by the sa user. For more information about running a SQL Client container and the environment variables required for the container, see SQL Client . The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script is used to create the login and user. The function requires the following environment variables to run: Environment variable Description SA_USERNAME The sa username. SA_PASSWORD The sa user password. DB_USERNAME The database user name. DB_PASSWORD The database user password. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Whether to use SSL for connection. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The path to the CA certificate.

    "keywords": "Managing container security SSL certificates in the deployment The example deployment is configured to use SSL connections for communication between clients and i2 Analyze, and between the components of i2 Analyze. To achieve this, the appropriate certificate authorities and certificates are used. The generateSecrets.sh script is used to simulate the process of creating the required keys and acquiring certificate authority-signed certificates. Note: The keys and certificates used are set to expire after 90 days. To use the certificates for longer than this, you must run the generateSecrets.sh script again. Certificate Authorities (CA) In the example, two CAs are used to provide trust: Internal CA The internal CA is to provide trust for the containers that are used for the components of i2 Analyze. Each container's certificates are signed by the internal CA. External CA The external CA is to provide trust for external requests to the i2 Analyze service via the load balancer. In our example, the external certificate authority is generated for you. However, in production a real certificate should be used. Container certificates To communicate securely using TLS each container requires the following certificates: Private key Certificate key Internal certificate authority The containers will generate truststores and keystores based on the keys provided to the container. For more information about how the keys are passed to the containers securely please see Secure Environment variables . Secure communication between containers When the components communicate, the CA certificate is used to establish trust of the container certificate that is received. Each container has its own private key ZooKeeper requires client authentication to initiate communication. The i2 Analyze, i2 Analyze Tool, and Solr client containers require container certificates to authenticate with ZooKeeper. Creating keys and certificates The following diagram shows a simplified sequence of creating a container certificate from the certificate authority and using it to establish trust: The certificate authority's certificate is distributed to the client. The private key is generated on the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the key is created by: openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096 The public part of the private key is used in a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). In the generateSecrets.sh script, this is completed by: openssl req -new -key server.key -subj \"/CN=solr1.eia\" -out key.csr The common name that is used for the certificate is the server's fully qualified domain name. The CSR is sent to the certificate authority (CA). The CA signs and returns a signed certificate for the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the CA signing the certificate is completed by: openssl x509 -req -sha256 -CA CA.cer -CAkey CA.key -days 90 -CAcreateserial -CAserial CA.srl -extfile x509.ext -extensions \"solr\" -in key.csr -out server.cer When communication is established, the container certificate is sent to the client. The client uses it's copy of the CA certificate to verify that the container certificate was signed by the same CA. Password generation The example simulates secrets management performed by various secrets managers provided by cloud vendors. The generateSecrets.sh generates these secrets and populates the dev-environment-secrets/simulated-secret-store with secrets required for each container. The docker desktop does not support secrets, but the example environment example simulates this by mounting the secrets folder. For more information see Manage sensitive data with Docker secrets . After these passwords have been generated, they can be uploaded to a secrets manager. Alternatively you can use a secrets manager to generate your passwords. Solr Basic Authentication Solr authorisation can be enabled using the BasicAuthPlugin. The basic auth plugin defines users, user roles and passwords for users. For the BasicAuthPlugin to be enabled, solr requires a security.json file to be uploaded. In our example the security.json file is created by the generateSecrets.sh and located in dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/secrets/solr/security.json . For more information about solr authentication see Basic Authentication Plugin Secure Environment variables In general secrets used by a particular container can be supplied via an environment variable containing the path to a file containing the secret, or an environment variable specifying the literal secret value, for example: Note: Secrets can be passwords, keys or certificates. docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia --secret source=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD,target=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD \\ -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE\" or docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=\"jhga98u43jndfj\" The docker files in the analyze-containers repository have been modified to accept either. The convention is that the environment variable must match the property being set with \"_file\" appended if the secret is in a file, and without if a literal value is being used instead. In the example scripts, each container gets the relevant key stores mounted along with the correct secrets files in a secrets directory. NOTE: By default this is set as CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR=\"/run/secrets\" in the common variables file. All the containers use the same environment variables to define the location of certificates. These are then used to generate appropriate artifacts for the particular container. There is also a standard way of turning on and off server SSL. Security switching variables Environment variable Description SERVER_SSL Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the container is configured to use encrypted connections. LIBERTY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the Liberty container use an encrypted connection. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the database use an encrypted connection SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to ZooKeeper and Solr use an encrypted connection. GATEWAY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true of false . If set to true , connections to i2 Connect connectors use an encrypted connection. SSL_ENABLED Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the connector container communicates with the i2 Connect gateway using an encrypted connection. Security environment variables Environment variable Description SSL_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the container certificate. SSL_CERTIFICATE The container certificate. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The Certificate Authority certificate. SSL_OUTBOUND_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections. SSL_OUTBOUND_CERTIFICATE The private certificate for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections.

For an example of the activities described, see the deploy.sh Running Solr and ZooKeeper The running Solr and ZooKeeper section runs the required containers and creates the Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble. Create Solr cluster The createSecureCluster function creates the secure Solr cluster for the deployment. The function includes a number of calls that complete the following actions: The runZK server function runs the ZooKeeper containers that make up the ZooKeeper ensemble. For more information about running a ZooKeeper container, see ZooKeeper . In deploy.sh , 3 ZooKeeper containers are used. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used a number of times to complete the following actions: Create the znode for the cluster. i2 Analyze uses a ZooKeeper connection string with a chroot. To use a chroot connection string, a znode with that name must exist. For more information, see SolrCloud Mode . Set the urlScheme to be https . Configure the Solr authentication by uploading the security.json file to ZooKeeper. For more information about the function, see runSolrClientCommand . The runSolr server function runs the Solr containers for the Solr cluster. For more information about running a Solr container, see Solr . In deploy.sh , 2 Solr containers are used. At this point, your ZooKeepers are running in an ensemble, and your Solr containers are running in SolrCloud Mode managed by ZooKeeper. Initializing the Information Store database The initializing the Information Store database section creates a persistent database backup volume, runs the database container and configures the database management system. The database backup volume is created first with the Docker command: docker volume create \"${SQL_SERVER_BACKUP_VOLUME_NAME}\" so that the volume will not be automatically deleted when the SQL Server container is remove. This helps maintain any backups created while running a SQL server container. For more information about docker storage, see Docker Storage . Running the database server container The runSQLServer server function creates the secure SQL Server container for the deployment. For more information about building the SQL Server image and running a container, see Microsoft SQL Server . Before continuing, deploy.sh uses the waitForSolrToBeLive client function and waitForSQLServerToBeLive common function to ensure that Solr and SQL Server are running. For more information, see Status utilities Configuring SQL Server The configureSecureSqlServer function uses a number of client and server functions to complete the following actions: The changeSAPassword client function is used to change the sa user's password.

The example provides a scripted mechanism to ingest data by using ETL toolkit. The script ingests data with and without correlation identifiers using both STANDARD and BULK import modes. For more information about ingestion, see: Information Store data ingestion Information Store data correlation To script the ingestion process, the following information is stored within the script: The mapping of item type identifiers to staging tables The mapping of staging tables to CSV files and format files. A list of import mapping identifiers from the mapping file. The script uses the runSqlServerCommandAsETL client function to import the data into the staging tables, and runEtlToolkitToolAsi2ETL to run the ingestion commands.

To ensure that data can be restored correctly, you must back up the components in the following order: Solr collections Information Store database If data is changed in the database after taking the Solr backup, Solr can update the index to reflect these changes when the collections and database are restored. When you create your backups, ensure that you store both backups so that you can identify the pair of backups that you must restore if required. Note: In the walkthrough, both the database and Solr backups are versioned using the variable backup_version . In the walkthrough the backup version is 1 . This is used to create a directory where the all of the backup files are stored for this pair. To create another backup pair, increment the backup_version so that the backup files are stored in a different directory. Backing up the Solr collections To back up Solr collections, you must have a shared filesystem available that is shared and accessible by all Solr nodes. In a containerized environment, a backup volume is shared between all Solr containers. Note: In the example, the backup volume is mounted to /backup in the Solr container. To ensure Solr can write the backup file, you must make sure the Solr process has permission to the backup folder. In order for Solr to write to the folder the user solr and group 0 must have read and write permission to the backup folder. The following chown command is an example that gives the Solr process permission to write to the backup location: chown -R solr:0 /backup The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the BACKUP API request. The backup operation must be performed for each non-transient collection. The non-transient collections are the main_index , match_index , and chart_index . The following curl command is an example that creates a backup of the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983//solr/admin/collections?action=BACKUP&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1/ \" To perform a backup operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the backup API command, see BACKUP: Backup Collection Note: The BACKUP API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the backup procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Backing up Solr section of the walkthrough script. Determining status of Solr backup The Monitoring Solr backup process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsyncRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous backup request. For more information about the client function, see getAsyncRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr backup progress section of the walkthrough script. Backing up the system match rules file The system match rules are stored in the ZooKeeper configuration, and can be backed up by using the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) from the Solr client container. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli command. The following command is an example of how to use the getfile command to retrieve the system match rules: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd getfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml Note: The system match rules file is backed up to the /backup/1/ folder where the Solr backup is located. For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . Backing up the Information Store database In the containerized environment, the mounted backup volume is used to store the backup file. Only the Information Store database is backed up. The SQL Server instance and system databases are not included in the backup. For more information about the backup volume, see Running a SQL Server . The backup is performed by a user that has the built-in db_backupoperator SQL Server role. In this case, that is the dbb user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsDBB client function to run the following SQL command to create the backup file. For example: runSQLServerCommandAsDBB bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"USE ISTORE; BACKUP DATABASE ISTORE TO DISK = '/backup/1/IStore.bak' WITH FORMAT;\\\"\" For more information about backing up a SQL Server database, see: Backup SQL Documentation SQL Server Backup Permissions For more information about the dbb user and it's role, see: db users See the Backing up SQL Server section of the walkthrough script."

    "keywords": "Restore This section describes the process to restore the Solr collections and Information Store database in SQL Server of an i2 Analyze deployment in a containerized environment. Understanding the restore process To restore the data and indexes for a deployment of i2 Analyze, restore the pair of Solr collection and Information Store database backups. To ensure that the data is restored correctly, restore the pair of backups in the following order: Information Store database Solr collections If any data has changed in the Information Store after the Solr backup, the Solr index is updated to reflect the contents of the Information Store database when Liberty is started. Preparing the environment Before you can restore the backups, clean down the Solr, ZooKeeper & SQL Server environment if you are not using a clean environment. See the Simulating Clean down section of the walkthrough script. Stop the liberty servers Before the restore process can begin you must stop the liberty servers. In a this can be done by stopping the containers The following command is an example of how to stop the liberty containers: docker container stop liberty1 liberty2 Restoring the Information Store database The process of restoring the Information Store database contains the following steps: Running a SQL Server container with a new instance of SQL Server Creating the Information Store database from the backup file in the new instance Recreating the required logins in the new SQL Server instance, and the users in the restored database Running a SQL Server container Run a container for the new instance of SQL Server, this will have the backup directory available. For more information about running a SQL Server container, see SQL Server . See the Running the SQL Server section of the walkthrough script. Creating the database from the backup file In a new instance of SQL Server, the only user is the sa user. Use the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function to run the following SQL command as the sa user to create the ISTORE database from the backup file: runSQLServerCommandAsSA bash -c \"/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -N -b -C -S sqlserver.eia,1433 -U \\\"\\${DB_USERNAME}\\\" -P \\\"\\${DB_PASSWORD}\\\" \\ -Q \\\"RESTORE DATABASE ISTORE FROM DISK = '/backup/IStore.bak;'\" See the Restoring the ISTORE database section of the walkthrough script. Recreating the logins and users In SQL Server, a login is scoped to the Database Engine. To connect to a specific database, in this case the ISTORE database, a login must be mapped to a database user. Because the backup is completed for the ISTORE database only, the logins from the previous SQL Server instance cannot be restored. Additionally, the database users are restored but there are no logins mapped to them. For more information about SQL Server logins, see SQL Server Login documentation In this environment, create the required logins and users by dropping the users from the database and recreating the logins and the users by using the createDbLoginAndUser client function. The logins and users are created in the same way as when original SQL Server instance was configured. For more information about creating the required logins, users, and permissions, see Configuring SQL Server in the deployment documentation. See the Dropping existing database users and Recreating database logins, users, and permissions sections of the walkthrough script. Restoring the Solr collections Restoring the solr indexes includes the following high-level steps: Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble Restore the non-transient Solr collections Monitor the restore process until completed Recreate transient Solr collections Restore system match rules Deploy a new Solr cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble To restore the Solr indexes, deploy a new Solr cluster & ZooKeeper ensemble. For more information about running a clean ZooKeeper & Solr environment, see Running Solr and ZooKeeper . Create Solr cluster . See the Deploying Clean Solr & Zookeeper section of the walkthrough script. Restoring the non-transient Solr collections The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the RESTORE API request. The restore operation must be performed for each non-transient collection that was backed up. The following curl command is an example that restores the main_index collection: runSolrClientCommand bash -c \"curl -u \\\"\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_USERNAME}:\\${SOLR_ADMIN_DIGEST_PASSWORD}\\\" --cacert /tmp/i2acerts/CA.cer https://solr1:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=RESTORE&async=main_index_backup&name=main_index_backup&collection=main_index&location=/backup/1\" \" To perform a restore operation, use the Solr Collections API. For more information about the Restore API command, see RESTORE: Restore Collection . Note: The restore API request must be an asynchronous call otherwise the restore procedure will timeout. This is done by adding async flag with a corresponding id to the curl command. In the above example, this is &async=main_index_backup . See the Restoring non-transient Solr collection section of the walkthrough script. Determining completion of Solr restore procedure The Monitoring Solr restore process section of the walkthrough script runs a loop around the getAsyncRequestStatus client function that reports the status of the Asynchronous request. For more information about the client function, see getAsyncRequestStatus . See the Monitoring Solr restore progress section of the walkthrough script. Recreate transient Solr collections Recreate the transient daod_index , vq_index , and highlightquery_index Solr collections. For more information about the creating Solr collections, see Configuring Solr and ZooKeeper . See the Recreating transient Solr collections section of the walkthrough script. Restore system match rules After the indexes are restored, upload the system match rules file. Use the Solr ZooKeeper Command Line Interface (zkcli) to create the directory in ZooKeeper for the system match rules file and to upload it. The runSolrClientCommand client function is used to run the zkcli request. The following command creates the directory in ZooKeeper where the system match rules file must be stored: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd makepath /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app Note: The path to where the system match rules file must be located is in the following format configs/<index name>/<index name>/app The following command uploads the system match rules file to the directory in ZooKeeper created earlier: runSolrClientCommand \"/opt/solr/server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh\" -zkhost \"${ZK_HOST}\" -cmd putfile /configs/match_index1/match_index1/app/match-rules.xml /backup/1/system-match-rules.xml For more information about the ZooKeeper command line utilities, see Using Solr’s ZooKeeper CLI . See the Restoring system match rules section of the walkthrough script. Start the Liberty containers After the Solr collections and Information Store database are restored, start the Liberty containers. The following command is an example of how to start the Liberty containers: docker container start liberty1 liberty2 After the Liberty containers have started, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceToBeLive common function ensures that the i2 Analyze service is running.

For example: DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN=\"i2c_istore\" Process overview: Create a custom connector image Update the configuration to reference connectors Build connector images and redeploy Creating a connector image Create a connector image from one of the image templates. You can deploy connectors using the following templates: Spring Boot for Java based connectors i2 Connect server for Node v14 based connectors developed using the i2 Connect server SDK NodeJS for Node v14 based connectors External for connectors hosted outside of the config development environment The connector should be secured and run on port 3443 . For more information about securing your system, see Securing i2 Analyze . Spring Boot based connector image Copy the /templates/springboot-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the springboot-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - target - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy your connector code into the target directory of the connector directory. For example, copy your .jar file into the <connector_name>/target directory. Next, configure your connector . i2 Connect server based connector image Copy the /templates/i2connect-server-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the i2connect-server-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - app - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ... Copy the i2 Connect server connector distributable ( the .tar.gz or .tgz file) into the connector directory. Next, configure your connector . NodeJS based connector image Copy the /templates/node-connector-image directory (including the sub-directories) to the /connector-images directory. Rename the node-connector-image folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - app - connector-definition.json - connector-version.json - ...

By default, the image will start node with the file app.js . Next, configure your connector . External connector Copy the /templates/external-connector directory to the /connector-images directory. Rename the external-connector folder to a custom connector name. The name of the directory is used to determine which connectors to deploy. Do not use spaces or special characters in the name. The directory structure is: - connector-images - <connector_name> - connector-definition.json Next, configure your connector . Configuring a connector Populate the values in the <connector_name>/connector-definition.json file with information about your connector. Key Description id An identifier that is unique for all connectors that will be deployed. name A name for the connector that is displayed to users in the client. configurationPath The full path to the configuration endpoint of the connector. By default, it is /config . gatewaySchema The short name of an optional gateway schema. When no gateway schema is used, do not provide a value. type Used to identify the type of connector. For i2 Connect server connectors, set to i2connect-server . For external connectors, set to external . For any other connectors, the type key is not required. sendSensitiveHeaders This setting effectively disables connectors that employ user-specific configuration. baseUrl Used only for connectors of type external . The baseUrl value is the URL address of the connector. For any other connectors, the baseUrl key is not required. For example: { \"id\": \"connector1\", \"name\": \"Connector 1\", \"description\": \"First connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template-schema\", \"sendSensitiveHeaders\": \"false\", \"type\": \"i2connect-server\" } or { \"id\": \"connector2\", \"name\": \"Connector 2\", \"description\": \"Second connector\", \"configurationPath\": \"/config\", \"gatewaySchema\": \"template-schema\", \"sendSensitiveHeaders\": \"false\", \"type\": \"external\", \"baseUrl\": \"https://example-connector:3443\" } Note: If your external connector is hosted in a Docker container on a different network to your config development environment, connect the Liberty container to the same network as your external connector container. For example, run docker network connect <connector-network-name> liberty1.<config-name> . If your connector is running on your host machine, use the IP address of your host machine in the baseUrl value. Provide the version of the connector in the <connector_name>/connector-version.json file. For external connectors, this file is not required. The version value specifies the version of the connector. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"0-0-1\" } For more information about configuring connectors, see Managing connectors . Adding connectors to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your connector with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file and add the directory name for your connector in the connectors array. For example, to add the connector in connector-images\\example-connector the connector-references.json file contains the following connectors array: { \"connectors\": [ { \"name\": \"example-connector\" } ], ... } Defining a gateway schema (Optional) You can develop the gateway schema and associated charting schemes by changing the deployment pattern to schema-dev and following the instructions in Developing schemas in your configuration development environment . After you develop the schemes, complete the following steps to add deploy them with your configuration: Copy the schema and charting scheme files to the /gateway-schemas directory. To define the short name of the gateway schema, the prefix of the file name is used. The convention is defined as: <short>-<name>-schema.xml and <short>-<name>-schema-charting-scheme.xml . For example, files with the names law-enforcement-schema.xml and law-enforcement-charting-schemes.xml have the short name law-enforcement . Add the short name of your schema to the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/connector-references.json file in the gatewaySchemas array. For example, to add a gateway schema with the short name law-enforcement , the file contains the following gatewaySchemas array: { ... ], \"gatewaySchemas\": [ { \"shortName\": \"law-enforcement\" } ] } Note: If you are not using any gateway schemas, do not remove the gatewaySchemas key from the file. Set the short name of your schema in the <connector_name>/connector-definition.json as the value for the gatewaySchema key of the connector that will use the gateway schema. Building the connector images and redeploying Run the ./deploy.sh script with your config name and the connectors task from the /scripts directory to generate the secrets for your connectors, build the connector images, and deploy your environment. ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t connectors After you add connectors to your environment, you can configure the rest of the configuration ."

Add any settings that are required by the extension to the analyze-settings.properties file. Add any resources that are required by the extension to the /configs/<config_name>/configuration directory. For example, the group-based-default-security-dimension-values.xml file. If your extension depends on another extension. You must add it to your pom.xml file under the comment: <!-- Extension specific dependencies --> . For example, the auditing extensions in Developer Essentials depend on the opal-audit-example-common extension. To add it as a dependency, populate the values of the pom.xml file as follows: <!-- Extension specific dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>com.i2group</groupId> <artifactId>opal-audit-example-common</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> </dependency> Adding extensions to a config In the configuration you want to deploy your extension with, update the /configs/<config_name>/configuration/extension-references.json file and add the directory name for your extension in the extensions array. For example, to add the extension in i2a-extensions/opal-default-security-example the extension-references.json file contains the following extensions array: { \"extensions\": [ { \"name\": \"opal-default-security-example\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" } ] } Note: The extensions in the extension-references.json file are loaded in order. If an extension depends on another extension, define the dependent extension first. Deploying your extension Use the deploy.sh script with the extensions task to build the extensions for your configuration. For example, to build and deploy the extensions declared in extension-references.json for your configuration: ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t extensions If you do not want to build and run all of the declared extensions, you can use the -i and -e options to include or exclude extensions from the process. For example, to build and run only the extensions named opal-default-security-example and opal-default-security-example-2 : ./deploy.sh -c <config_name> -t extensions -i opal-default-security-example -i opal-default-security-example-2 Debugging your extension Deploying in debug mode To deploy with one or more Liberty servers running in debug mode, change the local variable DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS in utils/internalHelperVariables.sh to be a list of the container names of the liberty servers you wish to run in debug mode. For example: DEBUG_LIBERTY_SERVERS=(\"${LIBERTY1_CONTAINER_NAME}\") Then deploy from a clean environment. When the Liberty servers start they all wait for a debugger to be attached before continuing. Note: Each Liberty server will open and expose a unique debug port (starting at port 7777) and wait for a debugger. This behavior is defined by the WLP_DEBUG_SUSPEND environment variable in the liberty container and could be changed if needed. Attaching a debugger The project is shipped with a default launch configuration which can be changed in .vscode/launch.json . Run the Java debugger by pressing F5 and choose Debug Extensions if asked."

This section also describes the messages that you should monitor to detect the failure and ensure that the recovery was successful. Before you begin the walkthrough, there are a number of concepts that it is useful to understand: How Liberty is deployed for high availability and the role of the Liberty leader. For more information about Liberty configuration, see Liberty . How a load balancer is used and configured in a deployment of i2 Analyze. For more information about the load balancer configuration, see Deploying a load balancer . That the load balancer is used to monitor the status of the i2 Analyze service. In a containerized deployment, all log messages are also displayed in the console. You can use the docker logs command to view the console log. The libertyHadrFailureWalkthrough.sh script simulates the Liberty leader failure. Identifying the leader Liberty To simulate a failure of the leader Liberty, first identify which server hosts the leader instance. To identify which container is running the leader Liberty, check the logs of the Liberty servers for the message: We are the Liberty leader . In the walkthrough script, this is done with the following grep command: grep -q \"We are the Liberty leader\" See the Identifying the leader Liberty section of the walkthrough script. Simulating leader Liberty failure To simulate leader Liberty failure, stop the leader Liberty. For example, if liberty1 is the leader, run: docker stop liberty1 See the Simulating leader Liberty failure section of the walkthrough script. Detecting failure The load balancer is used to monitor and determine the status of the i2 Analyze service. The load balancer is configured to report the status of the deployment. The status can be either ACTIVE , DEGRADED , or DOWN . When the leader is taken offline, the other Liberty server must restart to become the new leader. During this time, both servers are down and the i2 Analyze service is DOWN . When the new leader Liberty starts and only 1 of the servers is down, the status of the i2 Analyze services is DEGRADED . In the walkthrough, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is used to run a while loop around the geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function to wait until the i2 Analyze service is in the DEGRADED state. The geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is an example of how to return the i2 Analyze service status from a load balancer. See the Detecting failure section of the walkthrough script. Fail over When the Liberty leader fails, one of the remaining Liberty servers is elected as the leader. To identify the new Liberty leader, check the logs of the remaining Liberty servers for the message: We are the Liberty leader . See the Fail over section of the walkthrough script. Reinstating high availability To reinstate high availability to the deployment, restart the failed Liberty server. In this example, that restart the Liberty container by running the following command: docker start liberty1 When both Liberty servers are up, the status of the i2 Analyze services is ACTIVE . In the walkthrough, the waitFori2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is used to run a while loop around the geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function to wait until the i2 Analyze service is in the ACTIVE state. The geti2AnalyzeServiceStatus function is an example of how to return the i2 Analyze service status from a load balancer. The recovered Liberty server is in the non-leader mode when it starts because the new leader has already been elected while the server was unavailable. To determine it is in the non-leader mode, the following message is displayed in the logs: We are not the Liberty leader . See the Reinstating high availability section of the walkthrough script."

To access the configuration, the configuration directory must be mounted into the container. The CONFIG_DIR environment variable must specify the location where the configuration is mounted. Generated scripts directory : Some of the i2 Analyze tools generate scripts to be run against the Information Store database, or run scripts that were generated by other i2 Analyze tools. For the i2 Analyze Tool container to interact with these scripts, the directory where they are generated must be mounted into the container. In the example scripts, this is defaulted to /database-scripts/generated . The GENERATED_DIR environment variable must specify the location where the generated scripts are mounted. This directory must be created with your local user before mounting it to the container, otherwise docker will create this directory as a root. Environment variables To configure the i2 Analyze Tool container, you provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. The following table describes the supported environment variables that you can use: Environment variable Description LIC_AGREEMENT The license agreement for use the i2Analyze tools.

    "keywords": "Liberty In a containerized deployment, you configure the i2 Analyze application and Liberty in an image that is layered on top of the liberty_ubi_base image. The liberty_ubi_base contains static configuration and application jars that are required by i2 Analyze and should not be changed. Configuring the Liberty server Liberty is configured by exception. The runtime environment operates from a set of built-in configuration default settings, and you only need to specify configuration that overrides those default settings. You do this by editing either the server.xml file or another XML file that is included in server.xml at run time. In a containerized deployment of i2 Analyze, a server.xml file is provided for you. To provide or modify any values, you specify a number of environment variables when you run a Liberty container. Additionally, you can extend the server.xml by using the provided server.extensions.xml in the i2 Analyze configuration. Any elements that you add to the extensions file are included in the server.xml when you run a Liberty container. Configuring the i2 Analyze application The contents of the configuration directory must be copied into the images/liberty_ubi_combined/classes directory. The contents of the classes directory is added to the configured Liberty image when the image is built. If you make changes to the configuration, you must copy the changes to the classes directory and rebuild the configured image. Note: The system match rules are configured differently. The application is updated to use the system-match-rules.xml from the Solr client command line. For more information about updating the system match rules, see Updating the system match rules . Building a configured Liberty image The configured image is built from the base image. The configured image contains the i2 Analyze application and Liberty configuration that is required to start the i2 Analyze application. When you change the configuration, the configured image must be rebuilt to reflect the changes. Docker build command The configured image is built from the Dockerfile in images/liberty_ubi_combined . The following docker build command builds the configured image: docker build -t \"liberty_configured_redhat:4.3.5\" images/liberty_ubi_combined --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=\"liberty_redhat:4.3.5\" An example of providing the configuration to the classes directory and building the image is included in the buildLibertyConfiguredImage function in the serverFunctions.sh script. Running a Liberty container A Liberty container uses the configured image. In the docker run command, you can use -e to pass environment variables to Liberty on the container. The environment variables are described in environment variables For more information about the command, see docker run reference . Docker run command The following docker run command runs a Liberty container: docker run -m 1g -d \\ --name \"liberty1\" \\ --network \"eia\" \\ --net-alias \"liberty1.eia\" \\ -p \"9045:9443\" \\ -v \"liberty1_secrets:/run/secrets\" \\ -v \"liberty1_data:/data\" \\ -e LICENSE=\"accept\" \\ -e FRONT_END_URI=\"https://liberty.eia:9045/opal\" \\ -e DB_DIALECT=\"sqlserver\" \\ -e DB_SERVER=\"sqlserver.eia\" \\ -e DB_PORT=1433 \\ -e DB_USERNAME=\"i2analyze\" \\ -e DB_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/DB_PASSWORD\" \\ -e ZK_HOST=\"zk1.eia:2281,zk2.eia:2281,zk3.eia:2281\" \\ -e ZOO_DIGEST_USERNAME=\"solr\" \\ -e ZOO_DIGEST_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/ZK_DIGEST_PASSWORD\" \\ -e SOLR_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_USER=\"liberty\" \\sp -e SOLR_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/SOLR_APPLICATION_DIGEST_PASSWORD\" \\ -e DB_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SERVER_SSL=true \\ -e SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=\"/run/secrets/server.key\" \\ -e SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/server.cer\" \\ -e SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/CA.cer\" \\ -e GATEWAY_SSL_CONNECTION=true \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=\"/run/secrets/gateway_user.key\" \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/gateway_user.cer\" \\ -e SSL_OUTBOUND_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE=\"/run/secrets/outbound_CA.cer\" \\ -e LIBERTY_HADR_MODE=1 \\ -e LIBERTY_HADR_POLL_INTERVAL=1 \\ liberty_configured_redhat For an example of the docker run command, see serverFunctions.sh . The runLiberty function takes the following arguments to support running multiple Liberty containers: CONTAINER - The name for the container. FQDN - The fully qualified domain name for the container and the Solr host. VOLUME - the name for the named volume of the Liberty container. For more information, see Volumes . HOST_PORT - The port number on the host machine that is mapped to the port on the container. KEY_FOLDER - The folder with keys and certificates for the container. For more information, see Security . An example of running Liberty container by using runLiberty function: runLiberty liberty1 liberty1.eia liberty1_data 9045 liberty1 Volumes A named volume or a bind mount can be used to persist data, which is generated and used in the Liberty container, outside of the container. To configure the Liberty container to use the volume, specify the -v option with the name of the volume and the path where the directory is mounted in the container. By setting -v option in the docker run command, a named volume is created. For Liberty, the directory that is mounted must be /data , this directory folder stores: jobs, record groups and charts. For example: -v liberty_data:/data \\ -v liberty1_secrets:/run/secrets Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access ZooKeeper, the database, and the certificates used in SSL. The directory is used to update the named volume location defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as ZOO_DIGEST_USERNAME_FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. Environment variables To configure the Liberty server, you provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. The following table describes the supported environment variables that you can use: Environment variable Description FRONT_END_URI The URI that clients use to connect to i2 Analyze.

The runSQLServer does not take any arguments. Volumes Named volumes are used to persist data and logs that are generated and used in the SQL Server container, as well as a separate volume for backups, outside of the container. Note: It is good practice to have a separate volume for the backup from the database storage. For more information, see SQL Server Backup best practices . To configure the SQL Server container to use these volumes, specify the -v option with the name of the volume and the path where the directory is mounted in the container. By setting -v option in the docker run command, a named volume is created. For SQL Server, the path to the directory that must be mounted is /var/opt/mssql . For example: -v sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql -v sqlserver_sqlbackup:/backup For more information, see Use Data Volume Containers . Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access zookeeper and certificates used in SSL. The directory is mounted to a location in the container defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. This is achieved by using a bind mount. In production this would not be required. Example Data : To demonstrate ingesting data into the Information Store, the i2 Analyze toolkit is mounted to /var/i2a-data in the container.

ZooKeeper Service Ports Default ports used by ZooKeeper are: 8080 - By default, the server is started on port 8080, and commands are issued by going to the URL \"/commands/[command name]\", e.g., http://localhost:8080/commands/stat . 2181 - The port at which the clients will connect (non-secure). This is defined by setting ZOO_CLIENT_PORT . 2281 - The port at which the clients will connect (secure). This is defined by setting ZOO_SECURE_CLIENT_PORT . 3888 - Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other. 2888 - Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other. For more information, see ZooKeeper Service Ports . For an example of the docker run command, see serverFunctions.sh . The runZK function takes the following arguments to support running multiple ZooKeeper containers: CONTAINER - The name for the container. FQDN - The fully qualified domain name for the container. DATA_VOLUME - The name for the data named volume. For more information, see Volumes . DATALOG_VOLUME - The name for the datalog named volume. For more information, see Volumes . LOG_VOLUME - The name for the log named volume. For more information, see Volumes . HOST_PORT - The port number on the host machine that is mapped to the port on the container.

A bind mount can be used instead of the named volume: For example: -v /var/zk/data:/data \\ -v /var/zk/datalog:/datalog \\ -v /var/zk/logs:/logs \\ A unique bind mount must be used for each ZooKeeper container. Secrets : A directory that contains all of the secrets that this tool requires. Specifically this includes credentials to access zookeeper and certificates used in SSL. The directory is used to update the named volume location defined by the CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR environment variable. This can then be used by other environment variables such as SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE to locate the secrets. In a production environment, the orchestration environment can provide the secrets to the file system or the secrets can be passed in via environment variables. The mechanism that is used here simulates the orchestration system providing the secrets as files. Environment variables To configure ZooKeeper, you can provide environment variables to the Docker container in the docker run command. The zoo.cfg configuration file for ZooKeeper is generated from the environment variables passed to the container. The following table describes the mandatory environment variables for running ZooKeeper in replicated mode: Environment variable Description ZOO_SERVERS Specified the list of ZooKeeper servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble. Servers are specified in the following format: server.id=<address1>:<port1>:<port2>;<client port> . ZOO_MY_ID An identifier for the ZooKeeper server.

For example: DEPLOYMENT_PATTERN=\"i2c_istore\" Process overview: Provide a data set Create the ingestion sources Provide and run scripts to complete the ingestion process If you have deployed with the law enforcement schema, complete the steps in Example ingestion process to ingest example data into your Information Store. Data sets The /i2a-data directory is used to contain the data sets that you ingest into the Information Store of a deployment. The data that you ingest into the Information Store must conform to the Information Store schema. However, one data set can be ingested with different configs. There is not a 1-to-1 mapping between data sets and configs. Each data set must contain at least one ingestion script. This script contains the functions that populate the staging tables with your data and calls the ETL toolkit tools that ingest the data. The expected directory structure is as follows: - i2a-data - <data_set> - scripts - <script1> - <script2> Ingesting data into the config dev environment The manageData.sh script is used to manage the ingestion process in the dev environment. To ingest data into the Information Store, you must create scripts that call the ETL tools that complete the actions required by i2 Analyze for you ingest data. For more information, see: - ETL tools - Ingesting data into the Information Store You can find example scripts in the examples/ingestion/scripts directory. These scripts demonstrate how to create staging tables, populate them, and ingest the data into the Information Store. To run scripts, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t ingest -d <data_set> -s <script_name> Where: <config_name> is the name of the config that is currently deployed and running in the config dev environment <data_set> is the name of a directory in i2a-data <script_name> is the name of a script in the directory specified for <data_set> Creating ingestion sources The ingestion sources for a config are contained in the configuration. Ingestion sources are defined in <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh . Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts/createIngestionSources.sh file to the <config_name>/configuration/ingestion/scripts/ directory. In the script, the INGESTION_SOURCES array contains the name and description of 2 example sources. INGESTION_SOURCES=( [Example Ingestion Source 1]=EXAMPLE_1 [Example Ingestion Source 2]=EXAMPLE_2 ) You can modify or add to the array of ingestion sources. To create the ingestion sources in the array, the manageData.sh script is called as follows: ./manageData.sh -c <config_name> -t sources Example ingestion process The i2 Analyze minimal toolkit contains the example law-enforcement-data-set-1 data that can be ingested when the example law enforcement schema ( law-enforcement-schema.xml ) is deployed. This contains a number of CSV files that contain the data, and a mapping.xml file. For more information about the mapping file, see Ingestion mapping files . Before you can ingest the law enforcement example data, complete the following steps to provide the data set and scripts: Copy the pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory to the i2a-data directory. Copy the examples/ingestion/scripts directory to the i2a-data/law-enforcement-data-set-1 directory.

All the templates include a folder that you use to place the connector source code, the files used to build the Docker images and run the Docker containers, and JSON files that you use to provide information about the connector. For instructions about how to add connectors to your environment, see Adding connectors to your development environment . Connector versioning You specify the version and tag of a connector in the connector-version.json file of each connector. version The version value is used as a version for your connector. If you are deploying an i2 Connect server connector, the version value has more requirements. For more information, see i2 Connect server connector versioning . tag The tag value is used in the image name, host name, and secrets for your connector container. For example: { \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"tag\": \"1-0-0\" } Building connectors Use the deploy.sh script with the connectors task to generate secrets and build the images for all connectors.

There are two versions that you must consider; the version of a connector and the version of the i2 Connect server that the connectors depends on. Connector version In the connector-version.json file, the version specifies the range of supported versions for the connector. This enables you to have more control of the version of a connector that is used in your deployment. You can specify the range of versions at the major, minor, or patch level. For example, if you specify a major version 1 in the connector-version.json file, any connector that has a major version of 1 is compatible. When the connector is developed, the version of the connector is provided in the package.json file by the developer. If the version of the connector specified in package.json does not match the version, or range of versions, that you specify in connector-version.json a warning is displayed when you deploy your environment. The following table demonstrates how you can specify the version ranges and their compatibility with connector versions: package.json version connector-version.json version Compatible?

This enables you to develop the i2 Analyze configuration by using the config development environment, and deploy with it as part of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. This can be useful in the following situations: You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration. When you synchronize a configuration, you must do so with a complete i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. You can synchronize from an existing deployment toolkit configuration (import) or from an existing configuration development config (export). The configuration from the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit is the source of truth. When you have an existing deployment toolkit, the instructions direct you to back up the configuration before you synchronize it with the config development environment. You complete the synchronization by using the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script. Examples The following use cases demonstrate the process of synchronizing configurations between the config development environment and an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit: Use case 1 : You want to create a new deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to use the config development environment to develop the configuration for it. Use case 2 : You have an existing deployment that uses the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and you want to convert to use the config development environment to further develop the configuration.

Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the create task to create a base configuration in the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t create Where: -c is the name of the config. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was installed in step 2. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. Note: The base configuration that is created is suitable for the deployment pattern that is specified in the variables.sh file of the specified config. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task to export the config dev configuration into the deployment toolkit. ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the name of the config to export. -p is the full path to the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that was installed in step 2. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. You can then deploy your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . Start at step 3 from the linked documentation. There are a number of environment specific configuration files that are not populated in the config development environment. Use case 2 This section assumes that you are starting with a configuration from an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. For more information about deploying i2 Analyze, see Deploying i2 Analyze . The config development environment uses fixed names for schemas and configuration files. Before you can import you deployment toolkit configuration into the config development environment, your configuration must be updated to use the expected file names. The manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script can rename the files for you and update any references to them. You can also decide whether or not to use the config development environment configuration set in your deployment toolkit configuration. If you decide to use the new config set, all settings for the deployment must be specified in the analyze-settings.properties file. If you choose not to use the new configuration set, any additions that you make to the analyze-settings file in the config development environment are not exported. Back up your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. Fore more information about backing up your configuration, see Back up and restore the configuration . Use the config development environment to create an empty config to import your configuration in to. For more information, see Configuration development environment . You do not need to specify any schema files or deploy the config. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the prepare task to rename the schema and configuration files and update the references: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t prepare Where: -c is the config name you are working with. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. To use the config development environment configuration set, complete the following 2 steps. Otherwise, move to step 5. Copy the contents of templates/toolkit-config-mod directory to the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes directory of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. Review the settings that are used in the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files of i2 Analyze deployment toolkit and move any settings that you want to continue using into the /toolkit/configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes/analyze-settings.properties file. You can remove the DiscoClientSettings and DiscoServerSettingsCommon properties files after you move any settings. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the import task to import the configuration into the config development environment: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t import Where: -c is the config name to import the configuration into. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. Use the config development environment to develop the configuration. For more information, see Developing the configuration . In the config development environment, a user.registry.xml is required. You can start from the example provided in pre-reqs/i2analyze/toolkit/examples/security and align it to your security schema or copy in an existing one. If you want to use your developed configuration in your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, you can use the export task to export the configuration into your toolkit. Otherwise, continue to use the config development environment. Run the manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script with the export task. For example: ./manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c config-development -p /mnt/c/IBM/i2analyze/toolkit -t export Where: -c is the config name you have created to synchronize the configuration to. -p is the absolute path to the root of the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. On Windows, you must use forward slashes ( / ) and access the Windows filesystem using the /mnt directory in WSL. You must update the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit deployment with the changes to the configuration. Connectors In the config development environment, i2 Connect connectors are run on Docker images and can only be access from within the Docker network. This means that the connectors and URL references to the connectors cannot be synchronized between configurations. The connector IDs are displayed when you run the import and export tasks to enable you to provide the connectors in each environment. For more information about deploying connectors, see: Adding connectors to your config development environment Adding connectors to your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration Extensions In the config development environment, i2Analyze extensions are built and deployed using Maven. To add an extension to your i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, copy the JAR from i2a-extensions/<extension-name>/target/<extension-name>-<version>.jar and follow the DevEssentials deployment steps. For more information, see Configuring the 'group-based default security dimension values' example project for an example of the steps to take. manageToolkitConfiguration.sh script Usage: manageToolkitConfiguration.sh -c <config_name> -p <toolkit_path> -t { create | prepare | import | export } [-v] Options: -c <config_name> Name of the config to use. -p <toolkit_path> The absolute path to the root of an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit. -t {create} Creates a configuration in the i2 Analyze deployment toolkit that can be imported into the config development environment. -t {prepare} Prepares an existing i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration to be imported into the config development environment. -t {export} Export a config development environment configuration to an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration. -t {import} Import an i2 Analyze deployment toolkit configuration to a config development environment configuration. -v Verbose output. -h Display the help."

In SQL Server, you can create a number of database roles and assign users to roles. In the example deployment, a number of different roles and users are used to demonstrate the types of roles that might complete each action. Database roles In the example, the following roles are used: Role Description DBA_Role The DBA_Role is used to perform database administrative tasks. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role is used to move data from an external system into the staging tables in the Information Store database. i2_ETL_Role The i2_ETL_Role is used to read data from the staging tables and ingest it into - and delete it from - the Information Store database. i2analyze_Role The i2analyze_Role is used to complete actions required by the Liberty application. For example, returning results for Visual Queries. Database role permissions Each database role requires a specific set of permissions to complete the actions attributed to them. DBA_Role The DBA_Role requires permissions to: Set up and maintain the database management system and Information Store database. Create and modify the database management system objects. For example, bufferpools, tablespoons, and filegroups. Create and modify database objects. For example, tables, views, indexes, sequences. Troubleshoot performance or other issues. For example, has all privileges on all tables. This can be restricted in some environments. Configure high availability. Manage backup and recovery activities. Additionally, the role requires access to two roles in the msdb database: SQLAgentUserRole - for more information, see SQLAgentUserRole Permissions db_datareader - for more information, see Fixed-Database Roles These roles are required for database creation, to initialize the deletion-by-rule objects, and to create the SQL Server Agent jobs for the deletion rules. Note: The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is run during deploy to grant the correct permissions. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes All CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM Required to create the database objects. All ALTER, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, REFERENCES Required to make changes for maintaining the database. IS_Core EXECUTE Required for deletion-by-rule and database configuration. IS_Public EXECUTE Required to run the stored procedures for deletion-by-rule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the msdb database: Schema Permissions Notes dbo SQLAgentUserRole Required to create the deletion jobs during deployment, and to manage the deletion job schedule. dbo db_datareader Required to create the deletion job schedule. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the master database: Schema Permissions Notes All VIEW SERVER STATE Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs via the SQL Server Agent. sys EXECUTE ON fn_hadr_is_primary_replica Required for deletion-by-rule automated jobs. The configureDbaRolesAndPermissions.sh script is used to configure the DBA user with all the required role memberships and permissions. External_ETL_Role The External_ETL_Role requires permissions to move data from external systems into the Information Store staging tables. For example, it can be used by an ETL tool - such as DataStage or Informatica - to move and transform data that results in populated staging tables in the Information Store staging schema. The following table provides an overview of the permissions required on the schemas in the Information Store database: Schema Permissions Notes IS_Staging SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to populate the staging tables with date to be ingested or deleted. In addition to these permissions, in an environment running SQL server in a Linux container, users with this role must also be a member of the sysadmin group in order to perform BULK INSERT into the external staging tables.

IS_FP SELECT, INSERT, EXEC Required to complete Find Path operations. IS_WC SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE Required to work with Web Charts. The database backup operator role The example also demonstrates how to perform a database backup. The dbb user will perform this action and is a member of the SQL Server built-in role, db_backupoperator . This gives this user the correct permissions for performing a backup and nothing else. For more information, see Fixed-Database Roles for more details. Database users and logins In the example, a user is created for each role described previously. These users are then used throughout the deployment and administration steps to provide a reference for when each role is required. The following users and logins are used in the example: User and login Description Secrets sa The system administrator user. The sa user has full permissions on the database instance. This user creates the Information Store database, roles, users, and logins. The password is in the SA_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the SA_USERNAME file in the secrets/sqlserver directory. i2analyze The i2analyze user is a member of the i2analyze_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/liberty directory. etl The etl user is a member of External_ETL_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/etl directory. i2etl The i2etl user is a member of i2_ETL_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/i2etl directory. dba The dba user is a member of DBA_Role . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/dba directory. dbb The dbb user is the database backup user, it is a member of the SQL Server built in role: db_backupoperator . The password is in the DB_PASSWORD file, and the username is in the DB_USERNAME file in the secrets/dbb directory. The sa user and login exists on the base SQL Server image. The sa user is used to create the following artifacts: Database: ISTORE Roles: i2analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role, , i2_ETL_Role and DBA_Role Logins: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb Users: i2analyze , etl , i2etl , dba , and dbb The roles and users must be created after the Information Store database is created. Creating the roles The sa user is used to run the createDbRoles.sh client function that creates the i2Analyze_Role , External_ETL_Role , i2_ETL_Role , and DBA_Role roles. To create the roles, the createDbRoles.sh script is run using the runSQLServerCommandAsSA client function. This function uses an ephemeral SQL Server client container to create the database roles. For more information about the client function, see: runSQLServerCommandAsSA createDbRoles.sh All the secrets required at runtime by the client container are made available by providing a file path to the secret which is converted to an environment variable by the docker container. For example, to provide the SA_USERNAME environment variable to the client container, a file containing the secret is declared in the docker run command: -e \"SA_USERNAME_FILE=${CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR}/SA_USERNAME_FILE\" The file name can be anything, but the environment variable is fixed. For more information see, managing container security In the example, the createDbRoles.sh script is called in deploy.sh . Create the login and user Use the sa user to create the login and the user on the ISTORE , and make the user a member of the role. You can use an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the login and the user. The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script in /images/sql_client/db-scripts is used to create the login and user. The scripts are called from the deploy.sh scripts. The createDbLoginAndUser function The createDbLoginAndUser function uses an ephemeral SQL Client container to create the database administrator login and user. The login and user are created by the sa user. For more information about running a SQL Client container and the environment variables required for the container, see SQL Client . The createDbLoginAndUser.sh script is used to create the login and user. The function requires the following environment variables to run: Environment variable Description SA_USERNAME The sa username. SA_PASSWORD The sa user password. DB_USERNAME The database user name. DB_PASSWORD The database user password. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Whether to use SSL for connection. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The path to the CA certificate. DB_SERVER The fully qualified domain name of the database server. DB_PORT Specifies the port number to connect to the Information Store. DB_NAME The name of the Information Store database. DB_ROLE The name of the role that user will be added to. It has to be one of the roles from this list . Changing SA password In a Docker environment, you must start the SQL Server as the existing sa user before you can modify the password. The changeSAPassword function The changeSAPassword function uses an ephemeral SQL Client to change the sa user password. For more information about running a SQL Client container and the environment variables required for the container, see SQL Client . The changeSAPassword.sh script is used to change the password. The function requires the following environment variables to run: Environment variable Description SA_USERNAME The sa username SA_OLD_PASSWORD The current sa password. SA_NEW_PASSWORD The new sa password. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Whether to use SSL for connection. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The path to the CA certificate. DB_SERVER The fully qualified domain name of the database server. DB_PORT Specifies the port number to connect to the Information Store."

    "title": "Managing container security",
    "keywords": "Managing container security SSL certificates in the deployment The example deployment is configured to use SSL connections for communication between clients and i2 Analyze, and between the components of i2 Analyze. To achieve this, the appropriate certificate authorities and certificates are used. The generateSecrets.sh script is used to simulate the process of creating the required keys and acquiring certificate authority-signed certificates. Note: The keys and certificates used are set to expire after 90 days. To use the certificates for longer than this, you must run the generateSecrets.sh script again. Certificate Authorities (CA) In the example, two CAs are used to provide trust: Internal CA The internal CA is to provide trust for the containers that are used for the components of i2 Analyze. Each container's certificates are signed by the internal CA. External CA The external CA is to provide trust for external requests to the i2 Analyze service via the load balancer. In our example, the external certificate authority is generated for you. However, in production a real certificate should be used. Container certificates To communicate securely using TLS each container requires the following certificates: Private key Certificate key Internal certificate authority The containers will generate truststores and keystores based on the keys provided to the container. For more information about how the keys are passed to the containers securely please see Secure Environment variables . Secure communication between containers When the components communicate, the CA certificate is used to establish trust of the container certificate that is received. Each container has its own private key ZooKeeper requires client authentication to initiate communication. The i2 Analyze, i2 Analyze Tool, and Solr client containers require container certificates to authenticate with ZooKeeper. Creating keys and certificates The following diagram shows a simplified sequence of creating a container certificate from the certificate authority and using it to establish trust: The certificate authority's certificate is distributed to the client. The private key is generated on the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the key is created by: openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096 The public part of the private key is used in a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). In the generateSecrets.sh script, this is completed by: openssl req -new -key server.key -subj \"/CN=solr1.eia\" -out key.csr The common name that is used for the certificate is the server's fully qualified domain name. The CSR is sent to the certificate authority (CA). The CA signs and returns a signed certificate for the server. In the generateSecrets.sh script, the CA signing the certificate is completed by: openssl x509 -req -sha256 -CA CA.cer -CAkey CA.key -days 90 -CAcreateserial -CAserial CA.srl -extfile x509.ext -extensions \"solr\" -in key.csr -out server.cer When communication is established, the container certificate is sent to the client. The client uses it's copy of the CA certificate to verify that the container certificate was signed by the same CA. Password generation The example simulates secrets management performed by various secrets managers provided by cloud vendors. The generateSecrets.sh generates these secrets and populates the dev-environment-secrets/simulated-secret-store with secrets required for each container. The docker desktop does not support secrets, but the example environment example simulates this by mounting the secrets folder. For more information see Manage sensitive data with Docker secrets . After these passwords have been generated, they can be uploaded to a secrets manager. Alternatively you can use a secrets manager to generate your passwords. Solr Basic Authentication Solr authorization can be enabled using the BasicAuthPlugin. The basic auth plugin defines users, user roles and passwords for users. For the BasicAuthPlugin to be enabled, solr requires a security.json file to be uploaded. In our example the security.json file is created by the generateSecrets.sh and located in dev-environment-secrets/generated-secrets/secrets/solr/security.json . For more information about solr authentication see Basic Authentication Plugin Secure Environment variables In general secrets used by a particular container can be supplied via an environment variable containing the path to a file containing the secret, or an environment variable specifying the literal secret value, for example: Note: Secrets can be passwords, keys or certificates. docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia --secret source=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD,target=SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD \\ -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE=\"/run/secrets/SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD_FILE\" or docker run --name solr1 -d --net eia -e SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=\"jhga98u43jndfj\" The docker files in the analyze-containers repository have been modified to accept either. The convention is that the environment variable must match the property being set with \"_file\" appended if the secret is in a file, and without if a literal value is being used instead. In the example scripts, each container gets the relevant key stores mounted along with the correct secrets files in a secrets directory. NOTE: By default this is set as CONTAINER_SECRETS_DIR=\"/run/secrets\" in the common variables file. All the containers use the same environment variables to define the location of certificates. These are then used to generate appropriate artifacts for the particular container. There is also a standard way of turning on and off server SSL. Security switching variables Environment variable Description SERVER_SSL Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the container is configured to use encrypted connections. LIBERTY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the Liberty container use an encrypted connection. DB_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to the database use an encrypted connection SOLR_ZOO_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true or false . If set to true , connections to ZooKeeper and Solr use an encrypted connection. GATEWAY_SSL_CONNECTION Can be set to true of false . If set to true , connections to i2 Connect connectors use an encrypted connection. SSL_ENABLED Can be set to true or false . If set to true , the connector container communicates with the i2 Connect gateway using an encrypted connection. Security environment variables Environment variable Description SSL_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the container certificate. SSL_CERTIFICATE The container certificate. SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE The Certificate Authority certificate. SSL_OUTBOUND_PRIVATE_KEY The private key for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections. SSL_OUTBOUND_CERTIFICATE The private certificate for the Liberty container, which is used for outbound connections. SSL_OUTBOUND_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE The certificate authority used for verifying outbound connections. <!-- cspell:ignore jhga98u43jndfj >"

The tool outputs a message when the action is completed successfully and exit code 0 is returned. For example: > INFO [IndexControlHelper] - The server processed the command successfully: > Switched the live Match index from 'match_index1' to 'match_index2'. If there are any errors, the error is displayed in the console."

To update the schema in a deployment, you need to update the Information Store database and restart the application server. Updating the schema includes the following high-level steps: Removing Liberty containers Modifying the schema file Generating the database scripts to update the Information Store database Running the generated scripts against your Information Store database Running Liberty containers When you start Liberty, the schema that it caches from the database is updated Validating database consistency The updateSchemaWalkthrough.sh script is a worked example that demonstrates how to update the schema in a containerized environment. Note: Before you complete this walkthrough, reset your environment to the base configuration. For more information, see Resetting your environment . Removing the Liberty containers Before you update the schema in the Information Store, you remove the Liberty containers. To remove the containers, run the following docker commands: docker stop liberty1 liberty2 docker rm liberty1 liberty2 See the Removing the Liberty containers section of the walkthrough script. Modifying your schema In the updateSchemaWalkthrough.sh script, a modified schema.xml from the walkthroughs/configuration-changes directory is copied to the configuration/fragments/common/WEB-INF/classes/ directory. After you modify the configuration, build a new configured liberty image with the updated configuration. The buildLibertyConfiguredImage server function builds the configured Liberty image. For more information, see Building a configured Liberty image . See the Modifying the schema section of the walkthrough script. To modify your schema, use i2 Analyze Schema Designer. For more information on installing Schema Designer please see: i2 Analyze Schema Designer . Validating your schema After you modify the schema, you can use the validateSchemaAndSecuritySchema.sh tool to validate it. If the schema is invalid, errors are reported. See the Validating the schema section of the walkthrough script. The runi2AnalyzeTool client function is used to run the validateSchemaAndSecuritySchema.sh tool. runi2AnalyzeTool validateSchemaAndSecuritySchema Generating the database scripts After you modify and validate the schema, generate the database scripts that are used to update the Information Store database to reflect the change. See the Generating update schema scripts section of the walkthrough script. The runi2AnalyzeTool client function is used to run the generateUpdateSchemaScripts.sh tool. runi2AnalyzeTool generateUpdateSchemaScripts Running the generated scripts After you generate the scripts, run them against the Information Store database to update the database objects to represent the changes to the schema. See the Running the generated scripts section of the walkthrough script. The runSQLServerCommandAsDBA client function is used to run the runDatabaseScripts.sh tool. runSQLServerCommandAsDBA runDatabaseScripts After the database scripts are run, the Information Store database is updated with any changes to the schema. Running the Liberty containers The runLiberty server function runs a Liberty container. For more information about running a Liberty container, see Liberty . See the Running the Liberty containers section of the walkthrough script. Note: You must run both Liberty containers. The waitFori2AnalyzeServiceToBeLive common function ensures that Liberty is running. Validating database consistency After the system has started, the dbConsistencyCheckScript.sh tool is used to check the state of the database after the Information Store tables are modified. See the Validating database consistency section of the walkthrough script. The runi2AnalyzeTool client function is used to run the dbConsistencyCheckScript.sh tool. runi2AnalyzeTool dbConsistencyCheckScript"

    "keywords": "i2 Analyze containerized deployment The analyze-containers repository provides a containerized configuration development environment that you can use to develop i2 Analyze configurations, and a reference architecture to demonstrate how to build Docker images and enable you to deploy, configure, and run i2 Analyze on Docker containers. The repository is designed to be used with the i2 Analyze minimal toolkit. The minimal toolkit is similar to the standard i2 Analyze deployment toolkit, except that it only includes the minimum amount of application and configuration files. If you are already using the analyze-containers environment and want to upgrade to the latest versions, follow the instructions in Upgrading . Configuration development environment The process to deploy i2 Analyze in production is iterative, and includes a number of phases and environments. The containerized configuration development is designed so that it is easy to move between these stages. Because the environment is containerized, the provided scripts manage the creation of any containers that are required by the environment. For example, the database management system container is added to your environment when you specify a deployment pattern that includes it. You do not need to manually create it first. The following features of containerized configuration development environment are designed to enable you to develop i2 Analyze configurations: Simplified configuration directory The configuration directory structure is flattened to make it easier to locate files The directory includes placeholder configuration files so that you can add to existing files The XSD files are included to provide intellisense in VS Code Simplified deployment You can switch between i2 Analyze deployment patterns by changing a single setting. Use a single deploy command to deploy and update a deployment regardless of the deployment pattern used or any changes to the configuration Manage multiple configurations Develop and store multiple configurations Switch between configurations by using the deploy command Backup the database associated with a configuration Add connectors to the environment The environment can build images and run containers for your connectors To start developing configurations, see Creating your configuration development environment . Containerized deployment reference architecture The repository includes Dockerfiles and example scripts that provide a reference architecture for creating a containerized deployment of i2 Analyze. The scripts demonstrate how to build Docker images and enable you to deploy, configure, and run i2 Analyze on Docker containers. You can run the scripts to create a local example containerized deployment. For more information about the reference architecture, see Understanding the reference architecture ."
